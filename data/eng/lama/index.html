  They are gentle and empathetic. Scientists classify llamas as "charismatic megafauna", which means that they are one of the very few species that people can safely hug. Due to their calming and sweet nature, hospitals and nursing homes use llamas as therapy animals. Due to their extra-long bowels similar to camels, they can tolerate a long time without drinking water. Animals with a strong herd instinct can be authoritarian, but they are at the same time protectors. Dominance fights are almost like schoolyard fights involving spitting and trying to get each other out of balance. They can carry loads of 25 to 30 % of their weight.
