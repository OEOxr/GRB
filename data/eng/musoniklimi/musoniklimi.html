<div class="title">Monsoon Climate</div>
<br/>
<div>
	Strong winds, magnificent rain clouds and never-ending rain are among the distinctive features of the monsoon climate.
	Since this is the most humid type of climate, regions in this climate are under a very high risk of floods. The factor that determines the dry and rainy seasons is the monsoon winds. In winter, the wind is from land to sea, and in summer it is the other way round. Vegetation consists of forests with broad-leaved trees in summer while in winter, savannahs emerge.
	Monsoon climate is typical in certain parts of Asia such as the following countries: India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, South Korea, China and Japan. Among other parts of the world where monsoon climate is seen are Indonesia, the northern coast of Australia, Thailand and Madagascar.
