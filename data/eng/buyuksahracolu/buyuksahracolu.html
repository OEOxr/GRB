<div class="title"> Great Sahara Desert</div>
<br/>
<div>
The northern half of the African continent is mostly made up of deserts. This area is the largest and hottest desert on earth. It is approximately 2,000 km wide covers an area of 9,000,000 km2 stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea and into Asia. Sahara is estimated to be 2.5 million years old. There is no water in the desert except for rare rock wells and small oases fed by underground sources. In very few parts of the Sahara, the amount of precipitation reaches only 10 cm per year, with irregular periods. In the desert, the main source of moisture is dew. There have been regions in the Sahara without rainfall for up to 10 years. This desert, which is large enough to cover the territory of USA, is divided into three main parts: hamada (high flat areas consisting of stones and rocks), reg (vast areas of sand, gravel and stones with hard surfaces, deposited from old floodwaters) and erg, which are sand seas consisting of dunes. There are also mountains in the Sahara with heights of up to 3,000 meters, such as Ahaggar and Tibesti, which receive some precipitation, making them for nomads to settle. Plants and animals living in the Great Sahara have adapted to desert conditions. Plants have widely spread and deep roots to store water underground and minimize evaporation. Reptiles are more tolerant to heat than warm-blooded animals. The main problem for all creatures living in the desert is to be able to survive in the absence of water. The addax or mendes antelopes and desert hares are equipped with physiological properties for converting the water content from dry nutrients and plants into protein. After the discovery of petroleum in the Great Sahara, the delicate balance of desert wildlife has deteriorated and many desert creatures are near extinction.
