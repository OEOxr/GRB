<div>
  Thousands of years B.C., an indigenous race called the Mayan people used to live at the Yukatan Peninsula, Honduras and the Guatemala region at the northern end of South America. The Mayans, who reached the highest level of civilization among the Indigenous civilizations of prehistoric times, were the first to discover that a seed grows to turn into a plant. The Mayans, who were well ahead in astronomy and mathematics, built observatories and temples in the form of pyramids, which are now located in the city of "Chichen Itza", a major archaeological site, and the city's foundation is thought to date back about 500 years before Christopher Columbus's arrival to the continent. Named after Kukulkan, the most beloved of the Mayan gods, god of light and air, also knowledge, wind and the North Star, symbol of the cleanest beliefs of the Mayans, the Kukulkan Pyramid is a building where the Mayans exhibit their knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. When the top platform is added to the number of steps on its four surfaces, the result is 365, the number of days in one year. By way of light reflections that occur during certain seasonal periods, shadows form the body silhouette of Kukulkan, and it embodies many similar connections related to Mayan beliefs. From the highest point of the pyramid, the whole city can be viewed. There are many temples and observatories in the same area, and the Ancient Chichen Complex of monumental buildings is on the World Heritage List.
