Fennec is a small fox species native to the deserts of North Africa. Although they are the smallest fox species that exist, they have the largest ears by comparison to body size which are used both for hearing and to help control their body temperature in the harsh environments in which they live. Fennec foxes are nocturnal animals, which serves as a protection from the scorching African heat and from predators during the daytime. Male fennec foxes are known as "reynards‚Äù, and females are called "vixens".
