	The humid continental climate is one of the few climates with 4 distinct seasons. Hot and humid summers, cool and dry fall, cold and harsh winters, and warm and rainy spring are among the characteristics of humid continental climate. There are a wide variety of plants in these regions. In the north there are evergreen coniferous forests, and further south they mix with deciduous forests. Some areas with the humid continental climate are covered with grassland. These are sometimes called temperate meadows. This climate is perfect for farming, as it has warm summers and regular rainfall. It provides home for a wide variety of plants, as well as many different animals including bears, wolves, coyotes, deer and other small mammals. Thousands of birds live in this climatic zone. Similar to other animals living in climatic zones with a wide temperature fluctuation, most of these birds migrate in specific seasons.
