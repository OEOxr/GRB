<div>
It is the world's highest mountain range, stretching for 2,800 km between Arakan and Hindu Kush mountains. Its variable width reaches almost 300 km between the Ganges plain and the Kailash Transhimalaya range. Located across Pakistan, India, Bhutan, China and Tibetan territory, the Himalayas reach the highest peak on earth at 8,848 meters high "Everest" which is located at the border of Nepal and Tibet. The Himalaya is an Alpine mountain chain formed by the drift of the Indian continental plate and its collision with Eurasia. Above 1,000 meters, temperate and cold climatic belts prevail. The upper forest line is around 4,000 meters and the lower limit of continuous snow precipitation begins around 5,000 meters. In the Himalayas, variations in moisture distribution are seen. Eastern regions are very humid. Monsoon climate dominates the central parts while dry and rainy Mediterranean climate is typical at the west and desert climate prevails in the Transhimalaya part. Approximately 30 million people live in the entire Himalayas, majority of which dwell in villages at the warm-temperate belt at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Urban life is limited to low valleys (Kangra, Dehra), political and religious centers (Kathmandu, Srinagar) and regions with favorable climate (Simla, Darjeeling). At around an altitude of 2,000-2,500 meters, at the transition zone of two ecological environments, tropical and hot-temperate climates prevail where terrace farming allows the harvesting of crops (wheat, potatoes, corn, rice) twice a year. Above this altitude, agriculture and livestock farming are seen in separated terraces, and in the west, livestock transhumance at highlands is a widespread practice. Mountaineering has always made the Himalayas an attractive destination. The earliest expeditions began in the 1930s by the topographers of the Indian Geodesy Agency for spotting work and continued with the ventures of mountaineer groups that began to arrive soon afterwards. Between 1930 and 1940, none of the hills above the altitude of 8,000 meters could be reached and the highest point climbed was the Nanda Devi hill at an altitude of 7,816 meters in 1936. After 1945, thanks to advances in technology, all peaks with altitudes of 8,000 meters and more began to be climbed. Annapurna was climbed in 1950, Nanga Parbat and Everest were climbed in 1953. In August 1980, Reinhold Messner made a solo climb to the north slope of Everest. Nasuh Mahruki was the first Turkish mountaineer to climb the Everest on 17 May 1995.
