These are plants typical to the coastal countries of the Mediterranean Sea, coastal areas of California in North America, Chilean coasts in South America, the southern tip of South Africa and the climate belt plants seen in South Australia. On the slopes of mountains facing the sea, there are short trees such as scrubs, laurel, carob and olive. These plants are more tolerant to changes in temperature than the forest trees. In higher and mountainous areas, woodlands are found. The scrub plant community is a collection of plants consisting of small trees or shrubs 1 to 2 meters tall. They are small and hard-leaved and thorny plants with deep roots that have adapted to the arid conditions of the climate in which they live and have deep roots in order to cope with insufficient water. To prevent dehydration, the leaves are thick, hard and polished, or in some plants they are covered with resin. Examples of the most common trees and plants specific to scrubland are brier, bushy juniper, wild olive, mastic shrub, oleander, blackberry, wild strawberry, terebinth, myrtle, holy oak and sandalwood. Scrub plants form a very dense structure that almost obstruct the surface of the soil. These plants obtain some of their water from the humidity that builds up in the air during the night. Towards sea level, leaves are replaced by thorns.
