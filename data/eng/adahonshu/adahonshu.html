<div class="title"> Honshu Island (Japan)</div>
<br/>
<div>
Honshu Island is the largest and main island of Japan. It has worldâ€™s second highest island population after Java. Most of the population, which was 103 million in 2005, lives in the southern regions with habitable land, while 25% of the population resides in the Tokyo Metropolitan area. The island, with an area of 227,963 km2, is mountainous and volcanic, therefore seismic activity is high. The highest point above sea level is the peak of Mount Fuji at 3,776 meters. In addition to Mount Fuji, the Japanese Alps are also on Honshu Island. The Shinano River, Japan's longest stream, is located in Honshu. In the region where the Sea of Japan is located, the economy relies mostly on fishing and agriculture. The Niigata region of the island is an important center of rice production. In addition to rice, several other types of vegetables are grown at the plains of Kanto and Nobi. Yamanashi is an important fruit growing region and is famous for apples in the Aomori prefecture.
