<div>
One of the symbols of antique ages, Stonehenge is located at the plain of Salisbury, 20 km far from London, the capital city of United Kingdom. Its history dates to neolithic ages and it consists of 30 chisel carved rocks transported to the region, 17 of them in upright position, placed evenly along a large circle. On top of these circularly arranged stones, beam stones are placed, by which door-like openings are created. Although no definitive information has been obtained about why and by whom Stonehenge was built, numerous theories have been offered. Research findings make the subject interesting, such as the fact that the Stonehenge monument, which has been associated with phenomena such as paganism, astronomy, geometry and meteorology, was positioned in the direction of the Summer Solstice of June 21, and the Newgrange monument, which was built in Ireland at about the same time, was oriented towards sunrise at the turn of Winter Solstice of December 21.
