<div class="title"> Rhine River</div>

<div>
  The Rhine, one of the most important rivers in Western Europe, is born in the Swiss Alps. The upper reach of the river which feeds Lake Constance is mountain flood water consisting of the merging of the Front Rhine (Vorderrhein) and Rear Rhine (Hinterrhein), which flows rapidly to the northeast along a deep and narrow valley, reaches Lake Constance, then leaves the lake at its west and advances to Basel. This section of the river has been shared by Switzerland and Germany for the construction of several hydroelectric power plants for joint use. Leaving Basel, the river flows north through a valley of fertile farmland, then to the west passing through the Vosges mountains of France and the Black Forest of Germany, joining the Main and Neckar rivers coming from the east at the north. From this point on, it passes through steep slopes of a very narrow valley near Koblenz known for its famous wines and merging with Moselle River, it reaches Bonn, where the deep valley ends. In Cologne, it enters the Lower Rhein region and begins to irrigate plains. It next passes into the Ruhr District in Düsseldorf, a dense industrial site. The Rhine is an efficient transportation route from Basel to Rotterdam, where it flows into the North Sea. Ever since the Middle Ages, Rhein has brought prosperity to the settlements established on its banks.  Rhein’s role gained significance with the development of modern industry. The river has been a critical factor in the development of the Ruhr basin due to the transportation opportunities it provides. It is one of the busiest rivers in the world with particularly heavy traffic at the German-Dutch border. As a result of the works completed in 1992, Rhein has been connected to the Danube River through a channel that allows large ships to pass. Duisburg, Europe’s largest inland port, and the second largest port Mannheim are both located on the Rhine River. Large barges reach Strasbourg and smaller ones reach Basel. The river has a basin area of 185,000 km2 and flows a distance of 1,230 km. On the Dutch territory, the Rhine reaches a width of 1 km, before spilling into the North Sea after dividing into three branches, namely Waal, Lek, and Ijssel. The city of Rotterdam, the largest port in Europe is at the mouth of the Lek River.
