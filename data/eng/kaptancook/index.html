<div>
  Cook, an Englishman from Yorkshire, became a mariner at a very early age and joined the Royal Navy in 1756. In addition to being a master sailor, James Cook, was also an accomplished astronomer. In 1768 he was promoted to be a Captain and became commander of his first ship, the Endeavour. Cook, who was as competent in science as he was in navigation, under the influence of the academic atmosphere of the time set out for Tahiti in 1769 to observe the passage of the planet Venus between the earth and the sun.
  He was accompanied by a naturalist, a botanist and two painters. He also carried a sealed envelope that was given to him with the instruction of opening it only after all due observations were completed and recorded. In the spring of 1769, they reached the island of Tahiti and began their scientific studies of observing the planet Venus. At the completion of their work, opening the sealed envelope, Cook read secret orders to search and find the fifth continent, examine its assets and seize this continent on behalf of Britain. They took two native guides with them and headed for New Zealand.
  In the spring of 1770, they reached a gulf at the eastern coast of Australia, which James Cook called the Botany Bay as the region contained very different plant species. The crew then returned to England in 1771. James Cook charged two more journeys. In 1774, he sailed past the 70th parallel south to reach Easter Island. In 1779 he reached the Sandwich Islands, now called the Hawaiian Islands, where he was shot dead in a clash.
