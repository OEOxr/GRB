<div class="title"> Tropical Rainforests</div>
<br/>
<div>
They are forests consisting of broad-leaved plants and trees that are continuously developing and growing with the help of favorable temperature and humidity that prevail all year round. These forests receive at least 1,500â€“2,000 mm of precipitation annually. While some leaves reach the end of their lives and fall, new ones grow immediately, so these forests are always green. Rainforests have very lush and dense vegetation. In most places there are so many leaves that tree trunks are not visible. Very little sunlight can reach the forest floor directly and in some places, it is completely dark and quiet. In the rainforests three separate layers are seen. In the top and the highest layer there are trees with very large trunks with diameters from 80 cm to 20 m, which are 40-50 m high, and they do not show continuity. The second layer is trees that are 20-30 meters tall and dominate the appearance of the main rainforest, constituting 2/3 of the forest and showing continuity. Therefore, they exhibit a rather dense and intertwined structure. In the third and lowest layer are smaller trees and broad-leaved vines and shrubs.
