Sri Lanka is an island country at the south of India. Due to its geographical location, Sri-Lanka is an important sea route hub between West Asia and Southeast Asia. The island is located on the Indian tectonic plate. Although the coastline of the island consists of plains, the south-central part is elevated. This elevated area includes Mount Pidurutalagala with an altitude of 2,524 m marking Sri-Lanka's highest point. Climate is tropical and warm; precipitation is mostly regulated by Monsoon winds and parts of the island receive 2,500 mm of precipitation per month during the rainy season. Being part of the Indomalayan ecosystem, Sri Lanka is one of the 25 biodiversity points in the world.
