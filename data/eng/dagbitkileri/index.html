<div>
Mountain plants are defined as plants that are resistant to harsh windy climatic conditions, where the temperature is low and snow stays on the ground for a long time in winter, at the central and high parts of the elevated mountainous areas and in the top parts of mountains in tropical and semi-tropical regions. The common characteristics of these plants, which can be found in many different regions from the areas close to the poles to tropical and subtropical regions, are their growth periods and that they are short plants and they are drought tolerant. Most of them are plants that have undergone modifications and adaptations according to the conditions and characteristics of their habitat. Mountainous western parts of the north and south American continents, the mountainous parts of Ethiopia on the African continent, the Middle East and Himalayas on the Asian continent, and the eastern Siberian mountainous regions can be cited as the main habitats.
