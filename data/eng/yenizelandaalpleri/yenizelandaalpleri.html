<div class="title"> Alps (Southern Alps)</div>
<br/>
<div>
The mountain range along the west coast of the New Zealand island is called the Southern Alps. At 3,764 m, the Aoraki peak on Mount Cook is the highest point in the country, with more than 15 additional hills on the range with the lowest having an altitude of 3,048 m. There are glacial lakes at the eastern slopes stretching for 450 km from north to south, largest of them being Tasman, Josef and Seals. There are many glacial valleys and lakes on the Southern Alps and almost 3,000 glacial areas, the largest of which is the 29 km long Tasmanian glacier above the Pukaki glacial lake. At the eastern ridges of the Southern Alps, there are Coleridge and Wakatipu lakes in the north and Otago Lake in the south, also lined up as a chain. The climate is cold and snowy all year round at high altitudes. The eastern face of the mountains, above the forest line is flora-rich with Alpine plants. Beech forests lie below them and further below at the east there are high and rich pastures (Cantenbury and Otago pastures). Regarding the fauna, butterflies, flies and insects that have adapted to high altitude have become species that are unique to the Southern Alps. Lowland beech forests provide habitat for great spotted kiwis and kaka birds, which are endemic to this region. Four large national parks have been created to protect the unique flora and fauna, specific to this mountainous region.
