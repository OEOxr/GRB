<div>
Piranhas live in fast-flowing rivers and the Amazon basin. They are mostly found in freshwater regions of South America. The exact count of species is unknown but it is estimated to be between 30 to 60 or even more. There are varieties that live in the Amazon River of South America. Piranhas are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of foods, including fruits, seeds, insects, other fish and carrion. If they get trapped long enough in a pool of still water, they will probably attack anything that enters the water. Black piranha has the strongest biting force of any bony fish in the world. Its teeth are sharp and serrated, which makes it very skilled at tearing off flesh quickly. Piranhas can hunt large animals that enter their habitat by attacking in groups.
