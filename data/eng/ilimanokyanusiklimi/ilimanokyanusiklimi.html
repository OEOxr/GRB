	The temperate oceanic climate variety is a type of climate that prevails at the western coasts of the Central Belt continents, with the effect of hot water currents and west winds. The average annual temperature is less than 20°C. Temperature differences are not very pronounced. Summers are rainy and warm, and winters are rainy and cool.
	Oceanic climate vegetation is broad and flat with mixed forests consisting mostly of coniferous trees. Oceanic climate is also seen in areas where west winds are effective. In the subpolar variety, summers are cool, winters are warm, and there is precipitation in all seasons. The year-long precipitation is because the cloud formation rate is quite high. This causes limited sunshine. In this type of climate, daily and annual temperature differences are minimal due to the high humidity levels in all seasons. The annual precipitation amount is generally around 600–1,500 millimeters.
	As the elevation increases, the amount of precipitation also increases proportionally. The reason for this is explained as hillside precipitation since the winds come mainly from the sea.
	In addition to the influence of the west winds, temperate oceanic climate variety is also seen at the west parts of the temperate belt regions and more rarely at the eastern coasts. West and northwest Europe, western parts of Canada, southwestern Chile, southeast of Australia, southeast of South Africa and New Zealand are the regions where this climate variety is mostly effective. In Turkey, it is typically seen at the Black Sea coast but also prevails on the slopes of the North Anatolian Mountains overlooking the Black Sea region.
