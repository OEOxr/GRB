<div class="title"> New Guinea Island</div>
<br/>
<div>
			With an area of 785,753 km², it is the second largest island in the world and is located at the north of the Australian Continent. Its west part belongs to Indonesia and at the east there is Papua New Guinea. A mountain range which stretches 2,000 km from west to east, consists of large, curved, limestone masses that are separated by plateaus and plains and rise to 5,039 meters. This is a region with several fault lines underneath leading to frequent earthquakes and active volcanoes. Puncak Jaya is the highest mountain on the island at 4,884 meters. In the north, a long basin of depression is separated from the coast by coastal mountain ranges and to the south there are swampy plains and wide mountain slopes drenched by the Fly and Digoel rivers, where a warm and very rainy Equatorial climate is observed. Only in the southeastern regions an arid climate begins to prevail and forests are replaced by savannahs. The mountains receive a lot of precipitation and the slopes are covered with rich forests, while at high peaks small glaciers are seen. The island’s population of 6,400,000 people is made up of a variety of communities, commonly referred to as Papuans. Those who settle at highlands usually plant tuber plants such as sweet potatoes and also hunt and gather while those at lower regions, coconut, coffee and cocoa farming are important sources of income.
