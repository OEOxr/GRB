  The Opera House, one of the most famous buildings of the 20th century that became a symbol of Sydney and even Australia, is the work of Danish architect Jorn Utzorn. He was awarded the 2003 "Pritzker Prize for Architecture". The building is 183 meters long and 118 meters wide and covers an area of 1.8 hectares. Its roof is 67 meters high with an unusual form. Opened in 1973, the building consists of 5 separate halls: Concert hall with a capacity of 1547 people, opera theatre, drama theatre for 544 people, Playhouse for 398 people and Studio Theatre with 364 seats. There are also 5 rehearsal studios, 60 changing rooms, 4 restaurants, 6 bars and many shops in the building with a total of 1000 rooms. Its electricity capacity is enough to meet the needs of a town of 20,000 people.
