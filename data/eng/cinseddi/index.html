<div class="title">Great Wall of China </div>
<br/>
<div>
  It is the world's longest wall, stretching along the northwest of Chinese territory on the Asian continent. It is the only human-built structure that can be viewed from space. The remains, which begin at the coast of Gulf of Bo Hai, reach north of Beijing and turn west, splitting the Huang-Ho River in half and stretch to the southwest and continue westward along the south of the Gobi Desert. According to the official statement of the People's Republic of China, its length is 8,851 kilometers. Between 403 BC and 221 BC, during the Warring States Period, the giant structure was built in sections by the Northern States. It was later turned into a long continuous fortification of 6,000 kilometers by the first Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang to protect the country from raids of the Hun Turks. Chinese rulers later continued to extend the wall from 3rd century BC to AD 17th century. Today, the surviving part is a 2,500 km long structure from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Although the structural features and dimensions of the wall vary from place to place, in most parts it is around 4 to 6 meters high with 7 meters base width and in some places, it is built in several rows to facilitate defense. On the Great Wall of China, there is a watchtower every 200 meters and a lighthouse every 9 km, as well as palaces and temples. The Great Wall of China is one of the 7 wonders of the world.
