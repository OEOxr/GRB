Japan, consisting of volcanic islands along the Pacific Ocean coastline, is located on the volcanic geographical line called the "Ring of Fire". There are a total of 65 volcanoes in Japan, 60 of which are still active. The highest and most magnificent is Mount Fuji, with a height of 3,776 m. Throughout history, the Japanese have called it "Fuji San", the symbol of peace and tranquillity and it is considered a sacred mountain. It is located in Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park in Honshu, the "main island", 97 km southwest of the capital Tokyo. The Hoei-zan crater which was formed by an eruption in 1707 lies on the southeast slope with many small lakes and woodlands around it. Mount Fuji, which inspires many artists with its excellent conical shape and continuously snowy peak, is one of nature's most majestic beauties.
