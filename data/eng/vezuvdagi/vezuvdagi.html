Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano (1944) in the European mainland over the last century. It has an altitude of 1,280 m, and it is located at the east of Naples, Italy. Next to Vesuvius, Etna and Stromboli volcanoes are also on the Italian islands. During the eruption of Vesuvius, which is a stratovolcano, in AD 79 the cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum and Stabia were wiped off the map by pouring lava. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 people died under ash and lava in the ancient city of Pompeii, which was unearthed by archaeological excavations, and thanks to the layer of hardened lava covering the city, all items and bodies of citizens have remained intact to this day. Hundreds of thousands of people visit the ancient city of Pompeii every year. The site provides factual information about ancient Roman cities and the daily life of the time.
