<div>
Although this snake has a reputation for being aggressive, it is actually of a shy nature., It prefers to stay away from humans and other animals whenever possible. It is considered to be a solitary reptile. King cobras live in parts of southeast Asia, southern China, and India. Their habitats include forests, bamboo patches, streams and marshes. They live in warm and humid climates. They spend most of their time blending in dense, leafy branches in trees. Sometimes they hang from a tree branch to catch another snake. At other times, king cobras come down from trees to hunt on the forest floor. They can go to nearby streams in search of prey. These reptiles can swim quite well and have been seen to move in water. During late autumn and the cold winter, king cobras brumate in holes or burrows to keep warm. They come out again in the spring.
