They are located immediately below the Northern Forests in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, where seasonal differences are seen between winter and summer and the climate is not extremely cold. They originate at the British Isles and north of Spain and pass through the inland of Central Europe before extending into Russia. The climate of this region is very humid, with rainy summers and moderate winters. In the high mountainous parts of the region, conifers are found at climatic conditions similar to the Northern Forests. The trees that make up the summer forests begin to shed their thin and soft leaves during the fall. These fallen leaves prevent the soil at the forest floor from freezing during winter and in extremely dry summers they serve to keep the moisture of the soil. The most common trees of these forests are oak, beech, birch, hornbeam, walnut, chestnut, elm, maple and linden.
