<div>
Lake Tanganyika is located at the west of the Great Rift Valley (the great surface fracture in East Africa) lake system. It is the deepest and the second largest lake on the African Continent. Tanganyika, Africa's largest freshwater reservoir, is 673 km long from north to south and about 50 km wide, reaching 1,470 meters of depth in the northern parts. The lake is located about 780 meters above sea level. Lake Tanganyika which is shared between Congo, Tanzania, Zambia and Burundi, is home to thousands of fish species, nearly 300 of them unique to this lake. Fishing which is the primary economic activity of the region and the lake, has become industrial over time and provides income for about 50,000 people, and food for nearly 1 million people. In addition to exports of around 500 tons of fish per day, aquarium fish trade is also an important input for the economy.
