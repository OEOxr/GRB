<div class="title"> Jayhun (Amu Darya)</div>
</br>
<div>
Rising in southern Pamir in Afghanistan with the names Pamir and Piyanc, it is named Jayhun only after merging with Vakhsh in the north. Jayhun, which marks the border between northeastern Afghanistan and Tajikistan, reaches Lake Aral by a wide delta at the end of its journey. Including its longest branch Derya-yi Vahjir, born in the East Pamir Mountains, Jayhun reaches a length of 2,540 km. The historical region in Central Asia, which lies between the Seyhun and Jayhun Rivers currently in the territory of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, is called Transoxiana (Maveraunnehir in Turkic cultures). This region, which has historically been either homeland or transit zone of Central Asian Turks is famed for important cities such as Samarkand and Bukhara, where medieval Islamic civilization flourished. Therefore, it is an important area in terms of World and Islamic History.
