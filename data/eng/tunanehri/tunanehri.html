<div class="title"> Danube River</div>
</br>
<div>
	It is the second largest river on the European Continent. The area of the 2,850 km long basin is 800,000 km2. Its origin is the merging of the Brege and Berigach mountain rivers in the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) region of southern Germany at 678 m altitude in Donaueschingen. Danube never detaches from Europe's major mountain systems on its journey from west to east. Although it crosses some of the great plains of Central Europe, it feeds on branches that fetch the waters of the Alps, Dinaric Alps, Carpathians and Balkans, until it reaches its delta. It is an Alpine stream in terms of the origin and regime of most of its waters. During its long journey to Sulina where it spills into the Black Sea, it flows through the territory of 10 countries: Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine and Romania. The Danube River is fed by nearly 100 rivers in its basin. Among them are Drava, Tisa, Sava, Morava and Olt rivers. Danube is suitable for river transportation, with heavy traffic in a section of approximately 2,400 km. A journey through River Rhine beginning from the Netherlands can be extended to the Black Sea by connecting to the Danube thanks to canal crossings.
