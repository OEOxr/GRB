<div>
The great white shark is a large shark species which lives mainly in temperate and tropical coastal waters worldwide. They are found in South Africa, Australia, California and the northeast of the USA. These are the world's largest species of predatory fish, which grow to lengths of 8 meters or more and weigh over 2 tons. They use their dorsal fin for diving, navigation and stabilization. Their mouths are filled with up to 300 jagged, triangular teeth, arranged in rows and constantly replaced throughout their lives. Each tooth can grow up to about 6 cm in length and gives great white sharks a terrible bite when they attack their prey. After an estimated incubation period of 12 to 18 months, the female gives birth to between 4 and 14 offspring with a length of about 1.2 meters (or more) each at birth. Great white sharks are terrible carnivores that primarily hunt large marine mammals for their diet. Great white Sharks use their extraordinarily developed sense of smell to detect their prey. Amazingly, they are known to be able to smell blood in the water from half a kilometer away.
