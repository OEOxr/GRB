<div class="title"> Sonora Desert</div>
<div>
It is the largest and hottest desert in the Americas covering an area of 311,000 km2 in the USA and Mexico. Larger part of it is located in the southwest of the USA, in the states of Arizona and California, northwest of Mexico, east of the Gulf of California, Sonora and west of the Baja California Peninsula. Its starting point is the region of the "Great Basin" in the state of Nevada, North America, where highlands are located at about 940 m above sea level. The desert stretches from the Rocky Mountains to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountain range to the west, where short shrubs and sparse cacti are found in the arid terrain and coyotes, lynx, hawks and owls are common. At the southwest it reaches the "Death Valley" and the Mojave Desert. Death Valley is the hottest and the lowest point in the North American continent with an elevation of 82 m below sea level and with a temperature of 58Â°C degrees. Only about 5 cm of rain falls annually in this harsh region, where there are rocks eroded by intense winds, sand dunes that change shape and salt plains without any life on top. Despite all these adverse climatic conditions, more than 600 plant species, over 100 bird species and about 40 mammal species live in the region. Beyond the valley of death are the habitats of rattlesnakes, kangaroo mice, desert tortoises and cactus wren birds. Further south lies the lower part of the Sonora desert surrounding the Gulf of California, where giant cacti, thistles and saguaros grow. Saguaros can reach a height of 15 meters in places and weigh up to 2.5 tons, 90% of which is water. Saguaros are home to many creatures, from butterfly larvae to woodpeckers, from snakes to scops owls which are as small as a sparrow.
