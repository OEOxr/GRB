It is the 7th planet of the solar system in terms of proximity to the Sun. Uranus has 27 moons. Its five major moons (Miranda, Umbriel, Ariel (satellite), Oberon (satellite) and Titania) range in diameter from 500 to 1,600 km. It has been determined that there are 10 thin, sharply outlined and dark rings around Uranus. All of the rings consist of dark, rock-like fragments about 1 m in diameter. The structure of these has not yet been determined. Uranus spins like a wheel with its pole facing the sun. Therefore, its rings have an upright rotation. Uranus ranks third after Jupiter and Saturn in terms of diameter, and fourth after these two planets and Neptune in terms of mass.
