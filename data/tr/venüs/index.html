It is the second planet in terms of distance from the sun. It doesn't have a satellite. When it is visible, it stands out as the brightest object in the sky. It rotates in the opposite direction of all other planets in the solar system. Very dense carbon dioxide content in its atmosphere and continuous volcanic eruptions make Venus the hottest planet (475Â° C). Since it is observed in the sky close to the Sun and its orbit is closer to the Sun than Earth's, it can only be visible from the earth before sunrise or after sunset. That's why Venus is also called the Evening Star or the Morning Star. Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
