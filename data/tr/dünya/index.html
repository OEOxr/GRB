It is the third planet in the solar system in terms of distance from the sun. Its only natural satellite is the moon. Earth is the only natural celestial body known to contain life, with the highest oxygen content among other solar planets. Due to its solid or primarily ‘rocky' structure, it has given its name to the group of ‘terrestrial planets' of which it is also member. It is the largest member of this planet group in terms of mass and volume. It ranks fifth among the solar system's eight planets, ahead of the 'gas giants' by far.
