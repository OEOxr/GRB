Pluto is the second largest known 'dwarf planet' in the Solar System. It has three large moons, Charon, Hydra and Nix. Pluto's eccentric orbit has caused years long debates as to whether it should be considered a planet or not. On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union classified Pluto as a dwarf planet. Pluto, which was demoted from being planet 9 of the solar system to being a planet-like asteroid, it also had to be renamed. The Minor Planet Center responsible for indexing planet-like asteroids has assigned Pluto the new title of asteroid number 134340.
