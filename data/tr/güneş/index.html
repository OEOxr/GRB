The sun is a large, bright, heat and light emitting star located in the center of the Solar System, with its mass consisting of hot gases. The Sun alone accounts for 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System. The remaining mass consists of planets, asteroids, meteors, comets and cosmic dust all together orbiting the Sun. The energy emitted from the Sun in the form of sunlight allows almost all of life on Earth to be possible through photosynthesis and has significant effects on the Earth's climate and weather. The diameter of the sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth (1.5 million km), its volume is 1.3 million times and its weight is 333,000 times that of Earth. The density of the sun is 1/4 of the density of the Earth. The sun rotates around its axis at 70,000 km/h and completes one tour in 25 days. The surface temperature of the sun is 5500 °C and the temperature of its core is 15.6 million °C. Only 2 millionth of the energy from the sun reaches the earth. The energy emitted by the Sun in three days is equivalent to all fuels on earth including all petrol, trees, natural gas, etc. The sun's rays reach the earth in 8.44 minutes. The Sun’s gravitational pull is 28 times the earth's gravity.
