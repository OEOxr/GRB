It is the 6th planet of the solar system in order of proximity to the sun. Its number of moons reaches 56, not including those yet to be confirmed. Saturn consists largely of hydrogen and helium, just like Jupiter, and it is also classified as a gas giant. Saturn has the lowest density among all other planets. Its distinctive feature visible at first glance is its ring system. The thickness of individual rings is only about 100 meters. Saturn's rings are composed of large numbers of ice particles, the majority of which are thought to vary in diameter ranging from 1 cm to 10 m. Saturn is the second largest planet after Jupiter.
