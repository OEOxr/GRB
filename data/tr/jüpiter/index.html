It is by far the largest planet in the solar system with a size three times bigger than the other 7 planets combined. It ranks 5th according to the distance from the Sun. It has at least 16 known satellites and consists largely of hydrogen and helium and falls into the category of ‘gas giants’. Until recently, Saturn was the only planet in the solar system known to have rings. However, the Jupiter rings, suspected of being present after observations in 1973 by Pioneer 10, the first spacecraft to visit superior planets (planets farther away from the sun than Earth), were finally documented in photographs taken by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts in 1979.
