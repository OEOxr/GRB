It is the 8th planet of the solar system in order of distance from the Sun. It has 2 very pale moons called Triton and Nereid, the former being larger in size than the Earth's moon. It also has 13 known smaller moons. Neptune falls into the planet category of ‘gas giants’. It is third after Jupiter and Saturn in terms of mass and fourth after these two planets and Uranus in terms of diameter. Due to its distance to the sun, it is difficult to obtain conclusive information about this planet. But according to the Voyager 2 space probe which passed near the planet, Uranus has a radius of 22,300 km and completes one rotation around its axis in 17.24 hours.
