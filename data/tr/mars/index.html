It is the fourth planet in the solar system away from the sun. It has two small, irregularly shaped moons, called Phobos and Deimos. Because Mars has a reddish appearance due to the prevalent iron-oxide content on its surface, it is also commonly called as The Red Planet. Mars, which has a thin atmosphere is an earth-like planet with a surface that is marred with meteor craters similar to those on the moon as well as volcanoes, valleys, deserts and polar regions just like on Earth. Its rotation period and season cycles are also very similar to The Earth.
