Mercury is under heavy influence of the Sun's rays due to its proximity and is therefore a hot planet. Surface temperature can rise above 457° C during the long day of Mercury, while it drops to -172° C at night due to the absence of an effective atmosphere. It ranks last among the 8 planets in terms of size. Mercury reflects only about a tenth of the Sun's rays that fall on it. It follows a highly elliptical orbit that ranges in distance from the sun between 46 to 70 million kilometers. It has the second biggest eccentricity value seen among the other planets of the Solar System after Pluto.
