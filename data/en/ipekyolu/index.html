<div class="title"> Silk Road </div>
<br/>
<div>
As of 105 BC, camel caravans loaded with valuable goods from the Chinese civilization such as silk, jewelry, pearls and spices crossed Middle East and reached Antioch (Antakya) and from there the goods were sent to Rome by ships. This route from China to the West is known as the Silk Road. Chinese monks, who can be considered as pioneer explorers, played a key role in the establishing of this path. One of these adventurer explorers, Xuan Zang, was a Buddhist monk. In AD 629, he set out to reach India, the homeland of Buddhism, ignoring the emperorâ€™s rules banning travel. He crossed the dangerous Gobi Desert and the Hindu Kush Mountains to arrive at Kashmir. For two years, he made research in the libraries of the monasteries of the Ganges Valley and when he came to the city of Assam, surviving through various dangers and adventures, he joined King Harsha's expedition of 30,000 boats. He crossed the Indus River, moved north through the mountains, and 16 years later he arrived at the city of Chang'an in a carriage drawn by 20 horses, filled with nearly 1,000 religious books and Buddha statues. The following years saw commercial relations being established between China and India. In the 8th century, the Chinese had reached the Arabian Peninsula and the eastern coasts of East Africa.
