	<div>
Volcanoes with very large and deep bowls and potential to cause continental destruction and global climate change are called "Super Volcanoes". Super Volcanoes have a very large Magma chamber under their territory. Yellowstone Volcano's Magma reservoir, which is 60 km long, 40 km wide and 10 km deep, contains 24,000 km3 of magma. The region designated by scientists as a textbook example of its type, is at the Yellowstone National Park, located along the west coast of the USA, across the states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Seismologists call this area the Yellowstone Caldera, which is especially famous for its geothermal (underground hot water) mobility. Half of the world's total hot water resources are located here with a count of over 10,000. There are more than 300 geysers (a well that spurts hot water from underground to earth) in the Yellowstone National Park, the most famous of which is called “The Old Faithful” attracting 3.7 million visitors each year. Yellowstone Volcano is at least 2 million years old and hasn't erupted in 70,000 years, but it's not yet considered extinct. It is classified as the most dangerous super volcano for human life.
