<div class="title"> Yangtze River (Yangzi-Jiang)</div>
</br>
<div>
It is the largest river in the world to flow within a single country. With a length of 6,370 km, it is the longest river in the Asian continent and the third longest in the world after the Nile and the Amazon. Yangtze, whose source is at the Sichuan Mountains in western China, travels eastward across China and eventually reaches the East China Sea. From the point it merges with Min River to its mouth, it is highly suitable for transportation. The main centers of this traffic are the cities of Chongqing, Yichang, Wuhan, Nanjing and Shanghai. Approximately 250 million people live in the 1,800,000 km2 Yangtze basin. Fishing industry in the river based on the migratory fish that are born in the lakes of the central regions entering the river in the spring, is very lively and has an important place in the Chinese economy throughout history and today.
