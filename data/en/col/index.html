<div class="title"> Desert</div>

<div>
  These are areas where the annual precipitation average is below 100 mm and population density is extremely low due to climatic conditions. Contrary to widespread belief, the word "desert" defines not only hot regions, but also cold and arid areas. For example, Antarctica and much of Greenland are classified as deserts. Regardless of which latitude the desert is located at, its main feature is the lack of precipitation. While most deserts receive less than 200 mm of rainfall per year, the annual average in the Gobi Desert is 100 mm; in most of the Greater Sahara it is below 20 mm and at the worldâ€™s most arid point, Arica of Chile, average annual rainfall is below 0.8 mm per year. In hot deserts, the temperature difference between day and night exceeds 50 degrees, while in the deserts of Central Asia, a cold season is followed by a warm season. Plants have undergone various changes and adaptations in terms of physiology, morphology and anatomy in order to survive in the deserts. Desert plants do not like drought and they are usually annual plants, which means that they spend most of their lifecycle in the form of seeds, waiting for the brief period of rainfall to sprout and reproduce.
  Plants such as succulent species that have developed tolerance to drought by way of morphological adaptation, accumulate water in special organs or develop an extensive root system that help them reach groundwater. Drought-tolerant plants are adapted to consume as little water as possible and store the available water. They do this thanks to the fact that their leaves are small and thick, their pores small and protected, and their surface mostly sealed with wax or resin. Cacti are such plants. Like these plants, animals dwelling in deserts must cope with very harsh conditions as well. In the small number of desert animals, physiological and behavioral adaptations can be observed. They usually spend the hottest hours of the day underground or sheltered under plants. They hunt or search for food at night. Majority are small in size and certain animals such as kangaroo rats and camels use metabolic water produced in their body by burning carbohydrates such as fat and sugar.
