<div class="title"> Two-Humped Camel</div>
<br/>
<div>
Many people think that camel humps are water containers. In fact, the hump is filled with fat that the camel can access when needed. People currently living in Afghanistan and Turkistan were the first to domesticate two-humped camels around 2500 BC. Riding a camel was a status symbol in ancient Arab culture. Two-humped camels sleep at night and look for food during the day. After a rain, different herds gather in rivers, springs and other water sources, and a single camel can drink up to 57 liters of water at once. They are warm, friendly animals that form a bond of affection. Mothers and their kids are also extremely close and camels mourn for up to six months when a member of the herd dies.
