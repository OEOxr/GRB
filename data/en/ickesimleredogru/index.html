<div class="title"> The search for a new continent and Australia</div>
<br/>
<div>
Browsing through the literature about Australia's discovery, one can see that Captain James Cook (1728-1779) is the most popular name to reach our day. However, Dutch Captain Willem Jansz was the first European explorer to set foot on Australia in 1606, nearly a century before Captain Cook. In 1642, Abel Tasman, also a Dutchman had discovered Tasmania and then travelling further ahead, New Zealand. These discoveries had been possible thanks to the fact that the Netherlands had a powerful commercial fleet at that time.

By the winter of 1788, the British had seized all of Australia and established a colony there. In the late 18th century, the entire coastline of Australia was mapped. The exploration of the unknown inlands of the continent and thoroughly crossing it on land roads continued until 1861. The first explorers to cross the Australian continent by land from the south to the north coast were Robert Burke (1820-1861) and William Wills (1834-1861), but John McDouall Stuart (1815-1866) was the only one who could return alive.
