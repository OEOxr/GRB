  The first round tour of the world was intended for trade and colonialism. It took place under the command of the Portuguese noble explorer Magellan. Magellan, who had previously completed commercial expeditions, was in this case sailing on behalf of Spain because of a dispute with the King of Portugal. Spaniards wanted to seize the eastern islands of Maluku, famous for its precious spices. Magellan decided to follow an alternative route. Rather than following the usual route that the Portuguese always used to reach the East, namely, sailing around South Africa, he instead decided to turn his face to the west, heading to the southern end of the Americas and to continue westward until he reached Maluku. Finally, the journey, funded by King Carlos of Spain, began with the departure of about 300 sailors and five ships named Trinidad, Vittoria, Santiago, Concepcion and San Antonio in 1519. But the journey took much longer than Magellan's calculations. When they arrived at the coast of South America, it was already winter with a freezing cold. By the time they arrived at the coast of Patagonia, riots began due to the cold and lack of supplies, and the ship Santiago sank. Under very difficult conditions, the other ships were able to reach the Pacific Ocean through a narrow passage, now called the Strait of Magellan, thus proving that there is an alternative way to the East. The conditions of the voyage were getting worse, and while they were crossing the ocean, San Antonio left the fleet and disappeared, together with most of the food supplies. Therefore, some of the sailors starved to death until the fleet finally reached the Marshall Islands. When they later reached the Philippines, Magellan and forty of his sailors were killed in a war with local tribes.
  It became the duty of Captain Sebastian del Cano and about 100 remaining sailors to complete the expedition. Due to lack of staff, they abandoned Concepcion and continued to their destination. In 1521, they finally reached the Maluku islands. There were only two ships left: Trinidad and Vittoria. They loaded the ships with purchased spices, and they decided to use two different routes with the idea of increasing their chances of return. Trinidad headed east to Panama, where it was attacked by Portuguese, even though it was Spanish territory. Vittoria, on the other hand, headed west using the Portuguese commercial route. When it reached Spain in 1522 the travel around the world had taken three years.
