<br/>
<div>
  It is located in Java, one of the Oceanian islands of Indonesia. It is a 9th century Mahayana Buddhist temple and monument. It consists of six platforms stacked up as levels that shrink as they rise and 3 concentric circular platforms located on the top terrace. There are 72 buddha statues surrounding the inside of the main dome in the center of the platform, with over 2,500 ornate relief panels and 504 Buddha statues along the square platforms. The monumental stairs of the temple, a place of worship for Buddhist pilgrims, guides the pilgrims along their symbolic journey with 1,460 narrative reliefs. Borobudur has undergone many restorations since its construction, most notably in partnership with the Indonesian Government and UNESCO between 1975 and 1982. The temple, which is still used for pilgrimage and religious purposes today, is also Indonesia's most visited tourist destination.
