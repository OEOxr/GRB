<div>
It is a system of mountain ranges that rise by drawing long arcs along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey and reaches into Anatolia. There are two curves, one outer and one inner. The outer range consists of Mountains of Cyprus and their extensions, the Amanos mountains and the southeastern Taurus. The inner range begins in the north with West Taurus (Teke region, Sultan and Geyik mountains) which span along both sides of the Gulf of Antalya, connecting to Central Taurus between Taseli Plateau and Uzunyayla (Bolkar, Aladaglar, Hinzir and Binboga mountains) and finally joins eastern Taurus (Munzur, Karasu and Aras mountains) reaching the inland of Eastern Anatolia. The highest points of the mountain range are the Demirkazik Peak of Aladaglar (3,756 m) and Cilo Mountain (4,135 m) at the southeast end, but there are numerous peaks higher than 3,000 m. Taurus, which features unique natural beauties with canyons, caves, surface and underground streams, is also home to thousands of species with its rich flora.
