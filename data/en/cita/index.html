It is widely accepted that cheetahs have five different subspecies that differ slightly in coat color and are most easily distinguished according to their geographical territories. Although they are not considered to be part of the “big cat” family because they do not roar, cheetahs are nevertheless among Africa's most powerful predators and are best known for their enormous speed during a chase. Capable of reaching speeds of over 60 mph for short periods of time, cheetah is the world's fastest running land mammal. Although cheetahs are still present in several different regions of East and South Africa, the highest wild cheetah population is found in Namibia, Southwest Africa. Cheetahs are unique among Africa's felines in the sense that they are most active during the day and avoid food competition from other large predators such as lions and hyenas, who often hunt during the cold of the night.
