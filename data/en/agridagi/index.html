<div class="title"> Mount Agri</div>
<br/>
<div>
Agri is the highest mountain in Turkey. It consists of two peaks with the higher one reaching 5,137 meters (Greater Agri). The lower peak, Smaller Agri has an altitude of 3,898 meters. Agri is a volcanic mountain covered with a cap glacier that stays for four seasons and it is located within the Agri province of Turkey, at the extreme east of the country. Located at the south of the Igdir plain with a northwest-southeast orientation, Agri sits on an area of about 1,200 km2 and its circumference measures approximately 130 km around its skirt. It is made up of basalt rocks up to 4,000 m and andesite lava at higher altitudes. It is a young mountain of the stratovolcano type. Starting at 3,000 meters, it develops into two distinct cones rising on a shared base, the Greater Agri in the northwest and the Smaller Agri in the southeast. Turkey's largest glacier is located at the top of the mountain, where slopes become very steep, up to an angle of 35 degrees. The steep slopes of the mountain are scarred by deep valleys, running all the way from the peaks to the foothills. Agri is rather poor in terms of vegetation and water resources. Only at the lower altitudes, one can find shrubs and pastures where the locals benefit for their livestock. The first climb to Mount Agri, which is important in terms of history of mountaineering, was conducted by Prof. Frederik von Parrot and his team on 9 October 1829 and the first solo winter climb was carried out by Dr. Bozkurt Ergor on February 21, 1970.
