<div class="title"> Ganges River</div>
</br>
<div>
    It is born out of two floodwaters, Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers, which flow down from the central Himalayan glacier at an altitude of about 4,000 m in the northern part of the sacred cities of Badrinath and Kedarnath in northern India. These streams merge in Devaprayag and pass the Himalayas before entering the Hardvar plain, where The Upper Ganges is born. On its next lap, the river enters the Gangetic Plain by merging with Jamuna at its right bank, Godhra, Gandaki and Kosi rivers on the left. The most important region of the Ganges Valley is the industrial district where Calcutta and Hovrah cities are located. This region constitutes the general profile of India with its over-crowded cities, intensive agriculture and industrial diversity. Aside from the canals opened from its branches for irrigation purposes, the Ganges, which is used minimally in economic life, has gained importance mostly because it is the sacred river of India. According to Hinduism, the Ganges River is sacred; it represents the goddess Ganga and does not get dirty. Bathing in the river on certain days ensures riddance of sins, so Hindus literally live in the river, the dead are burned on the shore and their ashes are thrown into the river, even some of the dead bodies are left into the river. It is estimated that 1 billion liters of sewage flow into the river every day next to various industrial wastes, in the belief that the Ganges will never be contaminated. The Ganges is one of the dirtiest rivers on earth, although the government has implemented purification projects and legal measures. The Ganges basin covers 900,000 km2 and has a length of 2,700 km. The countries in its basin are India and Bangladesh. At the end of its course, it creates a delta of 105,000 km2 and flows into the sea from the Bay of Bengal.
