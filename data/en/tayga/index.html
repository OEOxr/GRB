<div class="title"> Taiga (Northern Forest)</div>
<br/>
<div>
This is a vegetation consisting of conifer and evergreen trees as a continuous forest belt found at the north of Eurasia and North America, to the south of the region where the Tundra vegetation begin. Larch, spruce, fir and pine are the most common plants. They cling to the soil with their shallow roots, which is mostly frozen and has few nutrients and thanks to their downwardly slanted branches, they allow the snow cover on them to fall. In addition to coniferous forests in the taiga, leafy, deciduous trees such as birch, poplar and rowan trees are also found. The trees are usually quite slender and weak, because most of the year (6 to 8 months) it is difficult for plants to grow via photosynthesis, since the sun stays low, near the horizon. Since the shallow soil that makes the forest floor is usually frozen, the falling leaves and moss remain fresh for a long time, without rotting and decomposing. Therefore, it is difficult for the soil to get enriched with nutrients. Branches of the trees facing the northern winds have almost no leaves. Further north, the forest is replaced by sparse and low growing forms of plant growth. In sunny areas, meadows are found and moss and lichens grow on forest floors and tree trunks. The taiga, which spreads as a belt getting as wide as 800 km in places, is home to many species of animals. Herbivorous mammals such as reindeer, North American grizzly bear, gulo luscus which is a rare species of marten that also belongs to America, weasels, raccoons, beavers and squirrels that feed on pine seeds, other minor rodents, predatory carnivores such as lynx, fox and wolf, Canadian grouse, long eared owl and eagle are primary residents of the Taiga vegetation.
