<div>
Tawny owls are also commonly known as brown owls and they are nocturnal birds of prey. This means that they can typically be found sleeping in their tree hole nests during daytime. However, during the early spring mating season, male owls can be seen hunting throughout the day to collect food for their mates. These swift owls are extremely loud in autumn, winter and early spring. During the night, they can often be heard making howling and squealing sounds. These various calls serve to mark their territory, communicate with other owls and attract a mate. They can be very hostile when they need to defend their nests. Tawny owls inflict more human injuries than any other bird species in Europe. They usually nest in dense forests and woodlands. These sheltered landscapes allow them to rest undisturbed throughout the day. They are mainly found in deciduous and mixed forests and prefer to be close to water. In urban environments, green areas such as cemeteries and parks are spots where they can be located. They also prefer plains, especially in cold climates.
