<div class="title"> Lake Superior</div>
</br>
<div>
With 82,100 square kilometers, it is the largest freshwater lake in the world by area and the third largest by volume. The average depth is 147 meters. Lake Superior is fed by more than 200 rivers and is connected to Lake Huron via St. Marys River. The lake is often exposed to severe storms which have caused many ships to be damaged or even sunk. At points deeper than 200 meters, the water temperature is almost always 4°C, therefore full circulation of water occurs twice a year. In relation with its volume, Lake Superior is poorer in terms of mineral content compared to other lakes in the region, and this also negatively affects the rate of reproduction of fish. Although the nitrate content of the lake’s water has increased in the last century, it is still well below the level harmful to human health but the lake is currently considered to be oligotrophic. Apart from the species that later arrived at Lake Superior intentionally or unintentionally, more than 80 local species are present.
