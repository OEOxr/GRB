<div>
        The Falkland Islands are an archipelago consisting of East Falklands, West Falklands and 776 islets at the South Atlantic Ocean, 460 km east of the South American mainland. Stanley, the capital and the only city in the archipelago, is located at the East Falklands. The country’s population of about 3,140 people is mostly of British origin. The two main islands have mountainous regions and in both of them the altitude reaches around 700 m above sea level. The total area of the archipelago is 12,713 km², while the coastline is approximately 1,288 km long. Its fauna and flora are similar to those of nearby Patagonia. At the time when Europeans discovered the islands, the only native land mammal on the island was a species of fox which became extinct in the 19th century. There are no reptiles or amphibians among the island's fauna but more than 200 species of insects, 43 species of spiders and 12 species of worms have been identified. Only 13 invertebrate animals are endemic to the island. The islands are covered with peat and have a cold and rainy climate. Sheep breeding for their wool is the main source of income. South Georgia and South Sandwich islands are territories of the archipelago as well.
