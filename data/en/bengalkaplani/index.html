<div>
Bengal tiger is the national symbol animal of both Bangladesh and India. The Bengals are larger on average compared to the other tiger species, but the largest tiger ever recorded was a Siberian. Therefore, the Bengals are considered the be the second largest tiger species. Today, wild Bengal tigers are found only in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. Having a period of early development which lasts up to three years, Bengal tigers are solitary cats. In rare cases, a group of tigers converge in the same area due a surplus of food sources.
