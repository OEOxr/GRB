It is the largest island on earth with an area of 2,166,086 km². The island, approximately 81% of which is covered by glaciers, is the home of the largest ice mass in the Arctic. The thickness of the ice sheet is 3km, with its base below sea level. In terms of geographical location, Greenland is located at the south of Arctic Ocean, northwest of Iceland and east of Baffin Bay. Greenland, an autonomous region of Denmark, gained independence from Denmark in 2008 on 32 areas after a referendum for expanding autonomy. Population is around 57,000 and the vast majority live in small towns along the west coast. The people of Greenland are of Kalaallit (Canadian Inuit) and Scandinavian origin and speak Greenlandic (Kalaallisut). In the native language, the Island of Greenland is called "Kalaallit Nunaat", the Land of the Kalaallits, while in Danish, Greenland means Green Country. Its climate is dry and sunny, with an average annual temperature of around -7°C.
