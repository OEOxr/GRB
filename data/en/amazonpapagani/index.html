<div>
Amazon parrots are native to South America, the Caribbean and Mexico, and wild parrots are found in the USA, Europe and South Africa. Some species may have a long lifespan of almost a century. Amazon parrots are sociable as a group and travel together in large flocks. They nest in the same area. The purpose of this behavior is to provide protection from predators. These parrots are herbivorous and their diet includes nuts, seeds, strawberries, flowers, fruits and leaves in the wild. Most parrots make their nests in tree holes and the female lays between two to five eggs, which she incubates for about a month. Amazon parrots do not migrate and they are considered "immobile".
