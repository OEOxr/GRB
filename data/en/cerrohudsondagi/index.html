<div class="title"> Cerro Hudson Volcano (Chili)</div>
<br/>
<div>
It is an active stratovolcano 1,905 m high, located 100 km northwest of the City of Chico in Chile's Aisen region. The eruption between August and October 1991 was one of the most violent eruptions of the last century, during which about 5 km3 of lava was discharged. Glaciers melted, mud avalanches filled valleys, erupting ashes rained down on Chile, Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Chilean cities Chico and Puerto Ingeniero Ibanez were largely covered in ashes.
