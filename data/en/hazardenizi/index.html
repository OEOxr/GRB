<div class="title"> Caspian Sea</div>
</br>
<div>
It is the largest lake on earth with both sea and lake characteristics. It is located at the southwest of the Asian Continent and the southeast of the European Continent, with Russia and Azerbaijan to the west, Kazakhstan to the northeast, Turkmenistan to the east and Iran to the south. It is 28 meters below ocean level, with a depth of approximately 25 meters at the northern parts, whereas in the southern bowl its deepest point at the foot of the high Iranian mountains is more than 1,000 meters deep. Average salinity of its water is 1.3%, increasing from north to south and from west to east. The surface level of the lake has dropped by 26 meters due to insufficient inflow of water from rivers being unable to compensate the evaporation caused by the dry continental climate at the region as well as dam and canal constructions on the Volga River, which provides 80% of the water flowing into the Caspian. The coastal line has also changed over time, and there are also deteriorations in the ecological balance as a result of petrol mining off Baku, although there are still plenty of sturgeon fish in the northern parts. The Caspian Sea is a commercial transportation route, except during the winter months. Baku and Iran's Bandar Torkaman are important ports. There are around 50 islands in the Caspian Sea. Continental climate at the north and mild climate in the central and southern regions prevail.
