The giraffe is a long-necked, hoofed mammal that grazes in the open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa as its natural habitat. Giraffes have nine subspecies located in different geographical areas and they differ slightly in terms of the color and design of their patches (spots). They are animals that live in open woodlands and savannahs, where they can take advantage of their ability to survey vast distances around them, easily detecting approaching danger. During times of tolerable temperature, they begin to ruminate and at other times they rest in the shade. Small herds of a few adult females and calves spend both day and night together to protect the young from predators, while male giraffes are usually solitary, and they often roam in large areas in search of a fertile mate. If they encounter a rival male, the two begin to bump their heads and clamp their necks together as a way of establishing a hierarchy of dominance. The winner is rewarded the right to couple.
