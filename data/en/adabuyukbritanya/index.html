Located at the northwest of Europe in the Atlantic Ocean, the British Isles are an archipelago consisting of Great Britain Island, Ireland, the Isle of Wight, the Isle of Man, Hebrides Islands, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, positioned in a north–south direction and separated from the continent by the North Sea and the English Channel. The total surface area is 218,595 km² and the archipelago is the third most densely populated island on earth after Java and Honshu islands. Western parts are mountainous with no significant altitude. The Ben Nevis Hill in Scotland is 1,340 m high and the Snowdown Hill in Wales reaches an altitude of 1,084 m. Although the Great Britain Island is located between the temperate climate zone at the south and the Arctic Circle climate zone at its north, it is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean climate from the west. With the influence of the Ocean, the climate is mild and humid with western regions abundantly rainy. The average annual rainfall ranges between 700 to 1,200 mm. Temperature variation between seasons is small. Average temperatures in winter months are around 5°C and summer months average at 17°C. It is a green island covered with vast meadows, low hills and forests, in terms of general geographical scenery. The island, shared by England, Scotland and Wales is connected to mainland Europe via the English Tunnel.
