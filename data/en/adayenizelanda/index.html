It is an island country at Oceania, 2,000 km southeast of Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. It consists of two large islands called North Island and South Island, and many other smaller ones. Its capital is Wellington and the largest and best -known city is Auckland. Although the climate is generally mild, the northern parts of the island are under the influence of subtropical climate, while at the ocean shores a soft and rainy climate prevails. However, inland at South Island temperatures drop to around -10Â°C in winter. The New Zealand Alps at the Southern Island reach a peak altitude of 3,764 meters on Mount Cook. Miocene glaciers have carved deep valleys which are filled with lakes or seas. Current glaciers also exist and cover wide areas. There are extinct volcanoes (Mount Egmond) and occasionally erupting active ones (Ruapehu) at the Northern Island. Except the Canterbury region, the width of plains is limited. They therefore receive much less rain compared to the southwestern mountains, which receive several meters of precipitation per year. Some of the mountains have beautiful forests, made up of conifers specific to the southern hemisphere and beech trees, which serve as habitat for rare birds, but in most places, forests have been replaced by pastures and pine species native to foreign lands. The number of Maori people who have lived on the island for nearly 1,000 years has decreased considerably due to epidemics and wars against Europeans since the beginning of the 20th century but the Maori population has increased again, currently being around 400,000. Agricultural production is limited to fields of wheat, barley and fruit trees. New Zealand is primarily a livestock breeding country, with a cattle stock of around 8 million and small cattle count of around 60 million. New Zealand is the world's largest sheep breeder by ratio to population. Wool, meat and dairy products account for 50% of all exports.
