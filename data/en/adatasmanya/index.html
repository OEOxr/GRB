At the South of Australia, it is the largest of the six states making the Federation of Australian Islands, with an area of approximately 68,000 km2 and surrounded with smaller islands around it. It is 296 km long from north to south and 315 km wide from east to west, separated from mainland Australia by the Bass Strait. The western mountains of the island which have a rather rugged terrain are open to western winds and they are covered with dense beech forests. At an altitude of about 800 to 1000 m, with occasional pointed peaks reaching 1500 m and with scattered lakes, the plateaus in the inner parts are covered with large pastures where cattle spread during summer. The mountains in the eastern parts receive less precipitation, and their hills are covered with eucalyptus forests. In these series of plains stretching from north to south, agriculture, livestock fodder plants, potatoes and apples are grown. Fishing is common throughout the island. Copper, zinc, lead and tungsten are the main mineral resources. Because it is geographically and genetically isolated, Tasmania has a unique fauna and flora. The diversity of species is remarkably high and many plant species on the island are unique to Tasmania. After the extinction of the Tasmanian tiger on the island, the so-called Tasmanian monster remains the world's largest carnivorous marsupial and is found only in Tasmania in a natural habitat.
