	Badgers are mostly nocturnal animals and in winter they spend most of their time underground, during which they fast. To be able to survive for an extended period of time deprived of eating, the badger accumulates a large amount of body fat in late summer and right before autumn. Every family of badgers tend to behave in its own ways but all species of badgers dwell underground. Some cohabit in clans known as a cete. Cete size varies from two animals up to 15. Badgers have the capacity to run, reaching speeds of 16 to 19 mph for short sprints. They are good climbers and can swim.
