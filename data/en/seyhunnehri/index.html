</br>
<div>
  It is the longest river in Central Asia with a length of 3,019 km, including Naryn River. The basin area covers 219,000 km2. Beginning in Kyrgyzstan from the Tian Shan (Mountains of God) mountains, with two branches, the upper branch Naryn originates in the high mountains at the southeast of Kyrgyzstan. In these regions their names are Kara Darya and Naryn rivers. Naryn flows westwards to cross Kyrgyz lands and merges with the Kara Darya within Uzbekistan in the Fergana Plain to form the Seyhun river. Merging with many branches joining from the neighboring mountains and moving westwards, it spans the Fergana basin and crosses the Mogoltau Mountain Range. Heading north, in the southwest of Tashkent it enters the Famine Steppe, located in the territory of Kazakhstan. There it merges with the Angren and Chirchik Rivers to curve towards northwest, flowing in the middle of a wide alluvial plain and finally forms a delta in the northeast of Lake Aral. The river, which is fed generously with melting snow and glacial waters from March to September, provides irrigation for large areas. Dams have been built on Seyhun for irrigation of agricultural areas as well as energy production, the largest of which is Kairakkum Dam. Thanks to these dams, irrigated agricultural land has expanded. Local people living on the banks of the Seyhun River grow black poplar, willow and cane.
