	The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean after the Pacific Ocean. It was formed by the division of the main continent and separates Europe and Africa from the Americas. The Atlantic Ocean, together with the Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea and Black Sea at the east, has a total area of 106,400,000 km2 and covers a fifth of the earthâ€™s surface. The length of the east coast of the ocean measures 50 thousand km, the length of the west coast is 80 thousand kilometers. The coasts of North America and Europe are highly indented. The most important formation at the floor topography of the Atlantic Ocean is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which extends from the north of Iceland to Bouvet Island at the edge of the Southern Ocean. This ridge divides the Atlantic Ocean into two more large ridges parallel to each other, divided into smaller basins with further orthogonal ridges. Mid-Atlantic Ridge is volcanic in origin. As one moves away from the valley of depression in the middle, the age of the crust increases. This tells us that the ocean is formed due to America's departure from Europe and Asia. Above the peaks of this ridge, which reach an elevation of 1,500-2,000 m underwater, islands such as Iceland, Asor islands, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and Gough Islands were formed. The largest island in the Atlantic Ocean is Greenland. The British Isles (244,000 km2) the Antilles, Newfoundland, Iceland, the Canary Islands, the Azores, Falkland Islands, South Georgia Islands, The Cape Verde Islands, St. Helana, Tristian de Cunha Islands, and many other small islands are found in the Atlantic Ocean.
	The Atlantic Ocean is the world's largest water collector. Half of the fresh water on earth flows into this ocean which therefore assumes a very important role in ensuring water balance. Rhein and Elbe from Europe, Congo and Niger from Africa, St. Lawrence, Mississippi, Orinoco, Amazon, Parana and Uruguay rivers from the Americas flow into the Atlantic Ocean.
	The temperature, down to 100 m deep, is the same as the temperature on the surface. At the parts where the surface is warm, as one goes deeper the temperature decreases and reaches the freezing point at the floor. In places with cold surface, the temperature increases as one goes deeper. Currents are responsible for this balance. The Gulfstream Current carries the warm water of the tropics, while the Labrador Current carries the cold water of the north to the south.
	The deepest points of the Atlantic Ocean are the Puerto Rico Trench (8,750 m) north of Puerto Rico, and the South Sandwich Trench (8,263 m) in the southern part of the ocean.
