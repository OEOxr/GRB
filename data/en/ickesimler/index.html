<div class="title"> The source of the Nile River and inland Africa </div>
<br/>
<div>
For centuries, the Nile River valley with its fertile soils and the origin of the river was a mystery. Ptolemaios, a Greek geographer, drew a map in AD 150 using compiled information and indicated at two lakes near snow-covered mountains in Africa that he believed to be the source of the Nile. This assertion resurfaced in the 1840s when German missionaries reported seeing two snow-covered mountains. The mountains they saw were Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. In 1856, the Royal Geographical Society in London sent Richard Burton (1821-1890) and John Hanning Speke (1827-1864) to Zanzibar, then known to be a major slave market. In 1857, the team set off towards the Ujiji Sea, now known as Lake Tanganyika. During the journey, they struggled with various diseases but finally managed to reach the Ujiji Sea in the winter of 1858. After their observations here, they found out that the lake was not the source of the Nile and returned to Tabora. Here the explorers parted their routes. Speke set out to find Lake Nyanza in the north, which he had heard about from the locals. After a smooth journey that lasted about two weeks, he reached the southern shores of the lake. In honor of the Queen of England, he named it Lake Victoria before returning to Tabora. Speke was assured that he had discovered the source of the Nile, but he did not have sufficient evidence to support this claim. Years after his suspicious death in 1864, explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley proved that Lake Victoria was indeed the source of the Nile River. Meanwhile, between 1852-56, British explorer David Livingstone became the first European to see the great waterfalls, which locals called “the roaring smoke”, and he named them Victoria Waterfalls. He was also the first European to walk across Africa. H. M. Stanley and David Livingstone met in Lake Tanganyika in 1871 and together they spent three weeks exploring the northern shores of the lake. Following Livingstone's death in 1873, Stanley traveled to Africa one last time to make his final discoveries on the continent. As a result of these discoveries, colonization of the African Continent by the Europeans began.
