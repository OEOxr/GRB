<div>
The Tigris River, which is born in the territory of Turkey, takes its waters from the Eastern Anatolian Mountains and Golcuk lake near Elazig. It has a total length of 1,900 km and a basin area of 258,000km2. The countries in its basin are Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. The section in Turkish territory is about 520 km long. It begins from a source in the southern part of Mount Hazarbaba in the Southeast Taurus Mountains, assuming the name Maden Brook, flows southeast towards the eastern part of Diyarbakir city, where the floor of the river valley descends to about 600 m. It then merges with Kurucay, Anbar, Pamukca, Hazroca, Batman and Garzan tributaries joining from the slopes of the Taurus Mountains. Goksu and Savur also join the Tigris near Mardin. Near the southern foothills of Raman Mountain, it merges with Botan and heads south. During this flow, it marks the Turkish-Syrian border for 40 km between Cizre district and Khabur River and enters Iraqi territory after merging with Khabur. It passes through narrow straits on Iraqi soil. In Mosul, it merges with Great Zab and Little Zab rivers before reaching the Mesopotamian plain. Near Baghdad, it merges with the Piyali River from Iran, approaches the Euphrates River and merges with it 65 km above Basra and together they flow into the Persian Gulf, taking the name Shatt al-Arab. The region located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is called Mesopotamia and it has been home to many civilizations throughout history. Although it is shorter than the Euphrates River, the Tigris has a greater water capacity. Its regime is irregular and this causes unpredictable floods from time to time. Throughout history various civilizations have tried to prevent these floods with barriers and dams but in vain. The construction of Kut Dam, which was the first dam in the real sense, started in 1939. Later, in 1958 Samarra Dam and in 1961 the Dokham Dam were able to prevent floods. On the Turkish part of the Tigris River, hydroelectric power plants such as Kralkizi, Batman and Dicle are located.
