Reindeer can run up to a speed of 80 km/h. They roam in large herds that can consist of tens of thousands of animals during summer months. As the weather begins to cool, the herd diminishes. This is also when most of reproduction in the herd takes place. Most reindeer are found in the northern hemisphere. Herds have been seen in Europe, Asia and North America. They prefer forests, as they are full of food sources that they need to survive. The dense vegetation of trees, such as pine, spruce and other coniferous trees, provide shelter for the reindeer. Trees provide protection from weather conditions and stealth against predators.
