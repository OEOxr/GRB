These are pieces of land covered with dwarf shrubs, land mosses and lichens, found between Northern Forests (taiga) and the polar regions. The tundra soil, which is covered with snow for more than 3/4 of the year, is frozen below, which prevents plants from reaching water supply for growth. In the tundra, trees such as shrubs and birch are very rare and they are usually dwarf. Due to the short growth period of tundra plants, leaf formation takes 2 to 3 years. With the warming of the weather in the spring, green leaves appear. Flowers follow in summer with increased rainfall and autumn brings berries and seeds. As the lakes thaw and streams overflow, thousands of insects wake up from hibernation. Moths, butterflies and insects of the bumblebee family begin a search for nectar among the flowers. Various species of flies mature in puddles and moss in lakes and swarm as dark clouds between June and August. In the summer, tundra are flooded with millions of migratory birds and tens of thousands of mammals from temperate regions of the earth. Ducks, geese and swans arrive from America, Asia and Europe. Millions of insect larvae become food for these long-legged creatures who come to breed in the fertile Tundra pastures. Caribous and reindeer come every year from the Northern Forests to the tundra region to eat grass and lichens under the melting snow.
