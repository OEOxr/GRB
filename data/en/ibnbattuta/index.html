<div class="title">Ä°bn Battuta</div>
<br/>
<div>
The events experienced by Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan Muslim who set out to Mecca in 1325 for pilgrimage, motivated him to travel further afar to unknown lands. This way, Ibn Battuta made adventurous and dangerous journeys to the Middle East, Africa and the Far East, then unknown to Western societies. During his journeys, he wrote down detailed accounts and notes in the Arabic alphabet. When he crossed Egypt to arrive at the Red Sea with the intention of making a sea journey to Jeddah, he found himself in the middle of a tribal war which made him change his plans. He returned to Cairo. Travelling through Jerusalem and Damascus he reached the city of Mecca. When he later went further north from Mecca to Baghdad, he saw that the city had been destroyed by the Mongols and he headed for Anatolia. After wandering in Anatolia for a while, he returned to Mecca to study law. When he had enough funds for new expeditions, he set off again. He crossed the Red Sea to Aden, from there he took an Arab sailboat to reach Zaila in Somalia, then he visited the coastal cities of Mombasa and Kilwa. He then followed the southern coasts of Arabia to the Persian Gulf, where he crossed into the Arab peninsula and returned to Mecca. Shortly afterwards, Ibn Battuta set off north. After Syria, Crimea and the Caucasus Mountains, he  reached Central Asia, Afghanistan and India. From there he arrived at China after a sea journey. In 1349, he returned to his hometown Fez, at Morocco, travelling through Malaysia and India.

<div class="title">Dangerous Journey</div>
<br/>
<div>
  It was year 1352 when Ibn Battuta began his journey to the middle of Africa. He had to cross the Sahara Desert to reach Mali. Both due to the extremely difficult physical conditions and the danger of bandit attacks, he joined caravans from time to time, managing to cross the Sahara Desert despite all its dangers to reach Terhazza, Tasarahla, Walata and then finally to Mali. He then continued along the Niger River into Africa. It was a risky but at the same time a very important journey since the destinations he reached had never been recorded by any traveller before. For four hundred years after Battuta, no other explorers visited these areas. On his way back home, he once again took a tough route over Timbuktu, famous for its treasures. Ibn Batuta is a very important explorer who has left us a legacy of detailed accounts of his journeys, which in total covered approximately 120,700 km.
