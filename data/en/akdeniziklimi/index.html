<div class="title"> Mediterranean Climate</div>
<br/>
<div>
	The Mediterranean climate defines regions or countries with hot and dry summers, rainy and warm winters.
	Regions with Mediterranean climate are usually found in locations overlooking the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts. This is due to the high amount of precipitation because of the elevated mountains near the coast. The Mediterranean coast is the region where the warm winter temperature is felt the most. The Marmara climate type is a variant of the Mediterranean climate with differences in average annual values of precipitation and temperature. This climate type is mostly seen in the south of Marmara region of Turkey as well as Thrace and Gallipoli regions and has the characteristics of a transitional climate between Mediterranean and Black Sea climates. The Mediterranean climate type with frontal winter rainfalls is seen in central Chile, Turkey, Africa, America, Austria, Portugal and Cape regions around the world. Typical vegetation is scrub, short evergreen trees, olives, daphne and carob.
	At regions with Mediterranean climate, the average temperature is around 15 - 18 °C throughout the year and the highest temperature is in July with an average value above 25 °C. In general, there is no precipitation in summer due to the desert climate interacting from the south. Although the precipitation intervals on this climatic type are frontal, they occur mostly during the winter season, between November and April. Because the mountains are parallel to the shore, the amount of precipitation increases in winter due to the influence of humid air.
