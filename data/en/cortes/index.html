<div class="title"> From Discovery to Invasion: Aztecs Destroyed</div>
<br/>
<div>
By the 16th century, changes had taken place in the purposes of discoveries and the qualifications of explorers. Previous purposes of the search for new trade routes and spreading Christianity were replaced by the idea of seizing the discovered region and all its resources, destroying or completely colonizing the indigenous population. The implementer of this idea was the Spanish army and individual adventurers. In the region known as Mexico today, the Aztecs who had established an important civilization used to live. The Aztecs had their own alphabet, legal system and religious beliefs. This community was highly advanced in architecture, sciences and art and they were also very skilled at weaving and gemstone carving. In 1521, Spanish invading commander Hernan Cortes (1485 â€“1547) attacked and laid siege to the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. No food and water were allowed into the city for three months. Despite abandoning all their gold to Cortes, Aztecs could not escape extinction, due to hunger, thirst and smallpox brought by the Spaniards from the European Continent. In a few years after the fall of the city of Tenochtitlan, little were left from the Aztec civilization.
