<div>
Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain of the African Continent, is located at the northeast of Tanzania, approximately 350 km south of the Equator. The highest peak of Kilimanjaro, an extinct volcano, is "Kibo" at an altitude of 5,895 meters. Two more peaks are Mawenzi (5,149 m) and Shira (3,962 m). It was declared a Natural World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987. Kilimanjaro, marking the border with Kenya, is at 200 km southeast of the capital Nairobi. The major eruption of Mount Kilimanjaro, with three distinct volcanic peaks, is estimated to have occurred 360,000 years ago. The most recent activity occurred about 200 years ago, while the formation of the mountain dates back to 1 million years. Crater gases are still emitted despite the volcanoes being dormant. Kilimanjaro exhibits a vast biodiversity but has a small number of endemic species. Apart from the forests at the humid southern slopes, below 3,000 m plants unique to Kilimanjaro named "senecia kilimanjari" and "impatience kilimanjari" are found. At about 2,000 meters, forests are replaced by alpine maquis, small pines and shrubs, and above 3,500 meters there is a stony and dusty desert. Farming on its outskirts has been a widespread practice since nearly 2000 years and the region with wide meadows has become a continuous habitat for African buffalos and elephants. Glaciers at the peaks of Kilimanjaro are estimated to have a basal age of 12,000 years and they cover an area of approximately 400km2 between the Kibo and Mawenzi peaks during the high time of the glaciers. Today, many tourists visit the Kilimanjaro Mountain, which is located within the Tanzania Kilimanjaro National Park and conservation area, for trekking and mountaineering purposes.
