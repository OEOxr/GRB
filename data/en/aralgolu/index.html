	    Located between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in West Turkistan, Aral is the second largest lake in the Asian Continent and the fourth largest in the world. Most of it is part of Uzbekistan. Lake Aral has shrunk by 80% since 1960 due to agricultural policies, increasing temperature and insufficient water inflow. Surrounded by the deserts of Karakum, Kyzylkum, and Ustyurt, a very hot and arid climate prevails in the summers and Lake Aral is gradually drying and shrinking because evaporation in the lake is greater than the amount of water that feeds it. The deepest part is 68 meters, while the other parts are usually around 20 meters deep. There is no lakeside settlement as its periphery is surrounded by deserts. A project to save Lake Aral by connecting it with the Caspian Sea is underway.
