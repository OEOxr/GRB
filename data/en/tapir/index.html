Modern day tapirs, in general, all have an elongated, versatile nose known as a proboscis. They use this flexible extension to collect strawberries, fruits and other types of plants from their environment. Their mouth contains 42 to 44 teeth, which are mostly flat, to help grind plants and fruits. Apart from the proboscis, these animals resemble wild boars in size and shape or rhinoceroses. They are usually solitary creatures. They gather in small groups called "candles" for reproduction and social interaction. Babies, known as calves, stay with their mothers until they are six to eight months old. Tapirs have a variety of natural habitats, depending on what species they are and where they are found. For example, the South American species with the scientific name Tapirus terrestris, lives in the grassy plains of Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador and Guyana. In contrast, Baird Tapir (Tapirus bairdii), roams parts of Mexico, Central America and northern South America. Mountain Tapir is smaller and woolier than its cousins and lives mainly at the Andes Mountains. Indian or Asian tapir is found in Cambodia, Indonesia and Laos. It has also been seen in Malaysia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Thailand and Vietnam. These animals love to eat in the forests and rainforests of these countries. All identified tapir species are listed as vulnerable or endangered on wildlife conservation lists. None of the four species has more than 4,500 members in the wild.
