<div>
The koala is a small mammal that dwells in diverse types of forests in southeastern Australia. They are surprisingly flexible and adaptable animals known to live in a variety of forest types, from tall eucalyptus forests to coastal areas and even at low forests inland. They move by jumping in trees. Koala is an herbivorous animal that feeds only on the leaves of the eucalyptus tree to survive. It also has an exceptionally long digestive system which is more than three times its body length, to help break down tough leaves. Everything from sleep to food and even reproduction is done in trees. they are very lazy and in fact spend 80% of their time sleeping or resting! Koalas have pouches and babies stay in the pouch until they are weaned at the age of 6 to 7 months. The young Koala then clings to its mother's back, where it can stay for a few more months.
