<div class="title"> Raccoon</div>
<br/>
<div>
  It is among the most common mammals in North America. Most of the animal's fur consists of dense gray sub-hair to provide insulation against the cold. They can jump to the ground from 40 meters. The raccoon is an animal with an excellent sense of touch. Their skillful paws can manipulate objects and open shells or seeds. Raccoons also perform well in intelligence and memory tests. They have the ability to solve complex problems as good as other intelligent species. Raccoon prefers a plant-based diet consisting of seeds, strawberries, nuts and tubers. After a gestation period of about two months, the female can deliver three to seven babies at a time. While the mother takes full responsibility for protecting and feeding her offspring, the father plays no role in the development of the baby. It goes on in this manner for 20 weeks.
