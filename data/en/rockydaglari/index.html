<div class="title"> Rocky Mountains</div>
<br/>
<div>
			This is a mountain range at the northwest of the North American continent, beginning at the Province of British Columbia in western Canadian territory, stretching 4,830 km south along USA territory at the Pacific coast. It passes through 7 states: British Columbia, Alberta, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. The highest point is Mount Elbert reaching 4,401 m, located in USA territory and the second highest peak is Mount Robson with a peak altitude of 3,954 m, located in British Columbia on Canadian soil. Regarding its overall geographical location, the mountain systems at the north with their border between the Liard River and British Columbia are also included. The Rocky Mountains is the most crucial geographical element shaping the American continent. It can be examined in 4 main segments from north to south as follows: The Arctic Rockies, Northern Rockies, Central Region and Southern Rockies. Regarding the climate and ecological characteristics, the average annual rainfall in the southern valleys is around 250 mm and in the northern hills it is around 1,500 mm. Average temperatures in February at Prince George of British Columbia is around -7°C degrees, while at the same period average temperature of Trinidad region at Colorado is around 6°C. Variations of ecosystems and climate systems are also observed in the Rocky Mountains region. The plains of the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains have large meadows at elevations of around 550 m and above the forest line there are Alpine tundras at altitudes around 3500 m in New Mexico. The same vegetation descends to 750 m in the Northern regions near Yukon.
			In the temperate forests of the south, a wide variety of pine trees such as pinyon pine, juniper, ponderosa pine as well as oak forests, spruce mixed with fir in cold and humid areas further north, white pines at edges of woodland or white pines that look like shrubs mixed with spruce can be seen. In short, Rocky Mountains with rivers, canyons and resulting unique forests have created a very rich ecological composition. During the period following the discovery of the American continent, the settlements of migrating Europeans, an economy based on mining and gold digging and a long-term fur trade in particular, greatly damaged the landscape and the ecosystems of the Rocky Mountains. Some species such as buffalos, wolves, bald eagles, tercels and grizzly bears are under threat of extinction and species such as white sturgeon, trout, bighorn mountain sheep have become scarce. Eventually, many conservation areas and national parks were established once settlements stabilized and with increasing awareness of the community, work was started to protect and sustain the rare species. There are currently 7 national parks in the USA territory, the best known being Yellowstone National Park, Pikes Peak, Rocky Mountain National Park, and 5 other national parks on Canadian soil. Today, many species such as deers, wild cattle, bighorn mountain goats, grizzly bears and black bears, lynxes, coyotes, martens, muskrat beavers and red squirrels populate the region. The most important mineral deposits of North America are to be found at the Rocky Mountains, including salt, iron, copper, gold, tungsten, as well as abundant energy sources such as oil, coal and natural gas, constituting the primary sources for the American economy. Dryland and irrigated agriculture, livestock and forest products are also important economical inputs as well as nature resorts with unique scenery and winter sports facilities attracting millions of tourists all year round, with their natural splendor.
