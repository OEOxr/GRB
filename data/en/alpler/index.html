This is an arc-shaped mountain range at the European Continent and spans an area of approximately 300,000 km2. The European Alps are located across France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia. The range can be examined in three main sections: the Western, Central and Eastern Alps. Examples of Western Alps include the Maritime, Cotian, Dauphine, Graian, Pennine Alps. The Maritime Alps gradually rise along the Italian plains and the Mediterranean Riviera, with peaks of around 3,000 m altitude in places. The Pennine Mountain Range is about 100 km long and it is located at the point where France meets Italy. The Mont Blanc, the highest peak in Europe with an altitude of 4,810 meters, is located at the Pennine Mountain Range. At the opposite end of the Pennine Alps are the 4,634 m peak of Monte Rosa and the 4,478 m Matterhorn summit which is at the Switzerland-Italy border. Another branch of the Central Alps is the Bern Alps, rising from the Rhine River Valley slopes. At this section, Finsterraarhorn (4,274 m), Aletschhorn (4,195 m) and Jungfrau (4,158 m) mountains constitute some of the most spectacular views of the Swiss Alps. The Eastern Alps are lower in altitude, but they are still significant due to the dense forests at their valleys. Bavarian Alps are a good example for this region. The Highlands of the Alps feature polar glaciers and ice rivers that serve as beds for glaciers. The largest glacier in this region is the Alesch, which is 1,690 km2 in size. There are many lakes formed by glaciers in the Alps such as Maggiore and Como in northern Italy and Geneva, Lucerne and Constance in Switzerland, among the best known. Europe's major rivers, such as the Rhine, Po and Rhone feed on Alpine streams. At the Alps with rich vegetation, the climate varies by altitude, but it is generally mild. There are vineyards and olive groves at the plains of the southern mountain skirts (Northern Italy). In the valleys, oak and beech, at higher elevations, black pine and spruce forests are common. Meadows begin at the end of these forests and mountain flowers are found around 2,000 meters. Bird species such as partridges, woodpeckers, moorfowls and waterfowls are populous. Hooded crows, ravens and eagles are also common birds and many species of fish live in rivers and lakes. Although not suitable for agriculture, the Alps are world famous for their livestock breeding and dairy products, especially cheese. The region is also the most important center for mountain tourism and winter sports with extraordinary landscapes and favorable climate. In terms of transportation, with more than 50 existing passageways, as well as many bridges and tunnels built later, the Alpine countries are well connected. World's longest motorway tunnel Mont Blanc (11,6 km) is located at the Alps.
