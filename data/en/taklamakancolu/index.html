<div class="title"> Taklamakan Desert</div>
<br/>
<div>
	It is the second largest sand desert in the world. It is 1,000 km wide from west to east and 400 km from north to south. Its surface area is about 320,000 km2. It is the largest desert on the Asian continent, located to the east of Tian Shan and Pamir mountains. About two-thirds of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China is occupied by the Taklamakan Desert, which is covered with a layer of sand, mostly 100 meters thick, up to 300 meters in places. In the oases at the foothills of high mountain ranges, rich vegetation is grown. Melting snow and glacial waters from the mountains of Khan Tengri feed the Tarim River and other small rivers. There are poplar forests along the banks of the river. Other common local plants are willow, silverberry, hemp, and very dense shrubs, as well as plants with deep roots that can survive in the adverse conditions of the desert, consisting of salty soils in places. Some of these plants are able to discharge salt through the scales on their stems.
	There are also salt lakes in the Taklamakan Desert. In these areas, the large body of groundwater which lies a few meters below surface is mainly melted snow from the surrounding mountain ranges. As in all the hot deserts in the world, animals feed and hunt at night to protect themselves from the heat. Lizards that feed on insects but in turn become prey to snakes and hawks themselves, have a critical position in the food chain of the desert. 16 distinct types of desert hares have been identified in Central Asia, and the double-humped camel, which is also specific to this region, constantly looks for new pastures as a solution to the drought. Taklamakan desert contains the richest oil reserves in the world.
