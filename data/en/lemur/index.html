The scientific Latin name of the lemur means "ghosts” or “spirits of the dead". This is due to the bright pale faces, large eyes and nocturnal habits of these creatures. Lemurs are foxlike animals with narrow faces. They have pointed ears and a tiny, damp nose. Their fingers are customized for easily grasping branches and fruits and their sharp claws help them climb trees. Some have longer hind legs that help them jump from one branch to another. Unlike other species of apes and monkeys, lemurs do not have grasping prehensile tails. A unique species of lemur called aye-aye is a small brown creature known for its spherical bulging eyes and a long, grasping middle finger. It uses this finger to dig out worms through holes in trees and branches. Lemurs spend most of their days flying across trees, looking for food. They live in groups called "troops". These troops can be made up of 6 to 30 lemurs. The members of the troop use alarm calls to warn each other of danger. These calls can vary depending on the species. Some calls may resemble a cat meow, some to a bird chirping, and some to grunts.
