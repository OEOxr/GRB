	The Southern Ocean is a body of water between Antarctica's coastline and the northern 60° latitude
This ocean is the fourth largest and most recently defined ocean in the world. (Some sources consider the South China Sea to be the 6th ocean)
The Southern Ocean was formed roughly 30 million years ago, by the drifting apart of Antarctica and South America continental plates and the opening of the channel now known as the Drake Passage, and the emergence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Therefore, it is a very young ocean compared to other oceans of the world.
The Southern Ocean, with a total surface area of 20.33 million km2, about 26 times the size of the Turkey’s surface area, includes the Amundsen Sea, the Bellingshausen Sea, part of the Drake Passage, the Ross Sea, a small part of the Scotia Sea, the Weddell Sea and other contributing bodies of water.
The coastline of the Southern Ocean measures 17,968 km. Water temperature ranges from -2°C to 10°C. The Southern Ocean is a deep ocean and reaches 4,000-5,000 meters at most places. Shallow waters are rare.
With a length of 21,000 km, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) always flows eastward. ACC is the world's largest oceanic current, and it displaces 130 million m3 of water per second. This is about 100 times the total flow of all the rivers in the world. The most important point of contraction is the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica.
The deepest part is the southern end of the Southern Sandwich Trench. (7,235 m)
