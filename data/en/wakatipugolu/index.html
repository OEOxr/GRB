Lake Wakatipu, or finger lake, is the longest and third largest lake in New Zealand with a length of 80 km. The bottom of the lake is 100 m below sea level; therefore, its depth reaches 420 meters. Its shape is in the form of an inverted letter "N". From the point Dart River feeds the lake at northern end, it stretches 30 km to the south, and then abruptly heads east. After spanning 20 kilometers to the east, it turns south again, where it reaches the southern end after about 30 km. Lake Wakatipu is surrounded by mountains, which makes it a popular destination for adventure tourism. Diverse types of trout and salmon are the most common fish that live in the lake.
