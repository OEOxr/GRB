Formerly called Yishan, Mount Huangshan is a mountain complex located in the south of Anhui province of the People's Republic of China and occupies an area of 154 km2. It has 77 peaks with altitudes of over 1,000 meters. It is an extremely impressive region with almost mystical qualities, blending into clouds in places. It has inspired many works of art throughout history. It is a unique natural wonder providing habitat to numerous species with unique granite rock formations, hot water sources, monumental pine trees, waterfalls and small lakes. There are 1,450 different plant species in its ecosystem. Huangshan, which is regarded as the most beautiful mountain in Asia and China, has a very important place in Chinese culture throughout history with its extraordinary beauty. Huizhou philosophy, Xin'an painting school, Xin'an school of natural medicine, Huizhou architecture, Anhui pot gardening (bonsai) and Huizhou cuisine have all been influenced deeply by the region. A saying that belongs to the local culture is as follows: "There is no need to see any more mountains after seeing Huangshan". Attracting thousands of visitors throughout the year, Huangshan has been declared a World Heritage Site.
