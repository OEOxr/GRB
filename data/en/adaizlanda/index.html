Iceland is a Scandinavian island country located in the North Atlantic Ocean. Approximately 320,000 people live in Iceland, which spans an area of about 103,000 kmÂ². Iceland is an active volcanic island. The central part of the island is a plateau covered with sand dunes, mountains and glaciers. Although it is close to the Arctic Circle, it has a relatively warm climate due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. 63% of the island is tundra. Iceland constitutes the border between the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate and being located at a point where the two plates meet, shapes the volcanic character of the terrain. Iceland has 30 volcanic systems and many geysers. It is known that when humans set foot on the island for the first time, the only native mammal was the arctic fox. It is also known that when the island was first inhabited, almost the entire land was covered with forests, which were later damaged by the settlers. The loss of woodland on the island has led to the fact that the betula pubescens, which was the most common tree on the island in ancient times, survives only in protected areas today. Many varied species of animals live in Iceland. The polar bear only comes to the island as a visitor.
