<div class="title"> Colorado River</div>
<div>
	It is located in the southwest of North America and northwest of Mexico. Its basin area measures 640,000km2. During its 2,330 km long journey, it travels through 7 states in North America and 2 states in Mexico. Its origin is a small resource located 40 km north of Lake Granby in the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, USA. With the contribution of the surrounding mountain waters, the Colorado river continues its way watering the farmlands in the east and carves its first canyon in this region (Little Yellowstone Canyon). Getting wider in the Kawuneeche Valley flows parallel to the town of Granby, then leaves the Rocky Mountains National Park territory. Within the State of Colorado, it merges with Fraser River and Blue River, creates more canyons and reaches the State of Utah. There are more than 20 dams and hundreds of irrigation facilities on the Colorado river. It merges with Green River in the Utah territory, joining with the Dolores River as it heads southwest near Fruita and pours into Lake Powell without leaving the state of Utah. The Colorado river is the cause of the canyon formations in the North American continent. The river flows through Arches National Park (near Moab) and Dead Horse Point State Park before reaching the state of Arizona where it forms the Canyons District National Park in. At the South of the town of Page, it forms the world-famous Horseshoe Bend. Then it merges with the Lees Ferry and Paria rivers to form Marble Canyon, joining the Little Colorado River at the southern end of the canyon, abruptly heading west and flowing through a curved crack in its plateau, forming the Grand Canyon and the Grand Canyon National Park. The park, which is about 400 km long, stretches along canyons and narrow gorges and extremely beautiful, colorful rock cliffs with heights up to 1,600 m in places. After joining with Virgin River in the state of Nevada, it spills into Lake Mead. Hoover Dam, one of the most important dams in America, is located here and produces all the energy needed at the city of Las Vegas. The river then sharply turns south, marking the border of the states of Arizona and Nevada, and feeds the dam waters used for irrigation of agricultural areas in the region such as Davis Dam, Parker Dam, Palo Verde and Imperial. As it moves towards Mexican territory, it merges with the Gila River near the city of Yuma to continue at low-lying fields and at sea level, flows in and out of the Morelos Dam, which irrigates Mexican farmlands and finally spills into the Gulf of California.
