<div class="title"> Henrique the Navigator (1394-1460)</div>
<br/>
<div>
  Henrique, the Portuguese prince who is often mentioned as Henrique the Navigator, pioneered the earliest efforts for discovering this new trade route. He built a shipyard, an observatory and a school at the coast of Sagres in southern Portugal in 1419, to train sailors. He commissioned scientists at his disposal to make overseas discoveries. Henrique arranged 14 expeditions over 12 years, but because of superstitions and fear, his sailors could not get any further south than Cape Bojador near the Canary Islands.
  When Henrique died in 1460, his ships had not reached the southern tip of Africa. Although he himself was not on board in any one of these expeditions, he is referred to as Henrique the Navigator, and he has inspired marine explorers who came after him.
