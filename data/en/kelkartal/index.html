<div class="title"> Bald Eagle</div>
<br/>
<div>
  It is one of the most popular animals in all of North America. This bird can see four to five times better than a typical human. It has superior color as well as ultraviolet light vision. Its field of view covers 340 degrees, which means that it can almost see the back of its head. The bald eagle has been the national symbol bird of the United States since 1782. They are among the fastest growing birds in North America, but it takes five years for the offspring to reach full maturity and gain adult plumage. The bald eagle has a normal flight speed of about 45 km/h but can dive at 150 km/h.
