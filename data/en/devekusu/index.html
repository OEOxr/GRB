When the Greek philosopher Aristotle was writing about the ostrich, he was not sure whether to classify it as a bird or a mammal. In fact, the ostrich is a flightless bird that is well adapted to life on land. The oldest ostrich fossils date back to around 20 - 25 million years ago. Ostriches are animals with multiple stomachs. Since they are not equipped with teeth and swallow their food as a whole, they have a series of three stomachs and exceptionally long intestines to assist their digestion. They also swallow pebble stones that serve to grind food in their stomachs. Some ostriches have more than two kilos of stones trapped inside their bodies.
