Lake Van, the largest lake in Turkey, is a volcanic terminal lake formed by the eruption of the Nemrut Mountain. The surface area is 3,713 km2. Lake Van, located at an altitude of 1,646 meters, does not freeze due to the high salt and soda content of its water, despite the harsh winter climate in the region. The average depth of the lake is 171 m, with the deepest point at 451 m. There are four islands in the eastern part of the lake: Akdamar, Carpanak, Adik and Kus islands. The salty and alkaline character of the lake has reduced the number of creatures in the lake. Planktons are present and there is only one species of fish that can live in the lake which is the pearl mullet. Lake Van was declared a protected archaeological site in 1990.
