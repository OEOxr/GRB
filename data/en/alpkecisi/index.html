<div class="title"> Alpine Goat</div>
<br/>
<div>
Alpine goats are ruminating mammals with split hoofs, horns, beards and large frames, capable of producing ample amounts of milk. Alpine goats are particularly known for being pleasing to the eye and having a variety of unique coat colors. The American Alpines tend to be larger than the original French Alpines, but the difference is often negligible. Mountain goats live in herds of 5 to 20 members unless a breeder or farmer separates them. These goats are elegant, curious and friendly towards their owners and the other animals of the farm. Almost all male mountain goats have beards. Female goats may also have beards, but this is extremely rare. The foremost predators that threaten domestic mountain goats are wild dogs, wolves, coyotes, mountain lions and other carnivores that roam near the farms where the goats are kept.
