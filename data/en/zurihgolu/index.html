<div class="title"> Lake Zurich</div>
</br>
<div>
Located at the southeast of Zurich, Switzerland, the 3 km wide and 42 km long Lake Zurich was formed during the last ice age when the flow of the Linth River was obstructed by glaciers, moraine and rocks. Its surface area is 88 kmÂ², the average depth is 50 meters, the deepest point is around 140 meters and its altitude from sea level is 406 meters. The first part of the two-part lake is a 28 km section in the canton of Zurich, stretching northwest of the dam connecting Rapperswil to the Hurden Peninsula. The second part, called Obersee (upper lake), where the dam water is collected, is 14 km long and it is located at the St. Gallen and Scwyz cantons. There are two small islands on the lake, Lutzelau and Ufenau.
