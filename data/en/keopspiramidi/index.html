<div class="title"> Pyramid of Cheops</div>
<br/>
<div>
The monument, thought to have been built in 2500 BC, is the largest and oldest of the three pyramids in the "Ancient Giza Necropolis" area of Cairo, capital of Egypt. The building has a square footprint. Each side of the base measures 230.37 meters and its height is 138 meters after erosion. calculated to be originally 146 meters at the time of construction. According to calculations made, its mass weighs 5.9 million tons and its volume is 2,500,000 mÂ³. Based on these figures, scientists estimate that the construction might have taken about 20 years. Until the early 20th century, the Cheops Pyramid remained the largest and tallest building in the world in terms of mass, volume, and height for nearly 4000 years. It remains to be an extraordinary work that has survived for thousands of years despite the wearing effects of the elements. The secrets of the pyramid, which has been investigated by hundreds of scientists and Egyptologist over a long period of time, remain unsolved. Sir Flinders Petrie, who conducted Cheops's earliest measurements between 1880 and 1882 had concluded that the mathematical relationships and proportions of geometric surfaces of the pyramid were too systematic and precise to be explained by chance and these ratios underline the design of the structure, which suggests that thousands of years ago the Egyptians knew the pi constant and the golden ratios. Thought to be a mausoleum built for Pharaoh Khufu of Egypt, Cheops is the main part of a collection of structures including two temples, a road that connects them and a group of tombs and smaller pyramids called "mastaba". The ancient Egyptian necropolis 20 km southwest of Cairo city consists of the pyramids of Cheops, Khafre and Menkaure and the Queen's pyramids, roads and valley pyramids. Remains of dormitories, bakeries, dining halls, hospitals, cemeteries and housing units thought to belong to the construction workers are still being excavated and mapping research still continue today. The Pyramid of Cheops is one of the seven wonders of the world, the only one that has survived to the present day.
