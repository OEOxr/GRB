<div class="title"> Albatross</div>
<br/>
<div>
The albatross is a native inhabitant of the Southern Hemisphere around Antarctica, South America, South Africa and Australia. According to an ancient sailorâ€™s legend, the albatross harbors the soul of a dead sailor killed at sea. Outside the breeding season, the albatross is almost constantly on the move. A typical individual can travel thousands of miles every year. It has the ability to swim on the water and glide in the air with minimal effort. Albatross feeds on squids, krills, shoals of fish and, less commonly, zooplankton. They breed in the form of eggs, and development of the young bird is slow and difficult. The baby spends several weeks in a defenseless state. It takes another 3 to 10 months before it acquires the ability to fly and begins hunting for itself.
