	The High Mountain climate is specific to high altitude regions. The most distinctive and pronounced feature is that the temperature is low compared to the surrounding plains. Another obvious feature is that the daily temperature difference is high. The main characteristics of the mountain climate, where increased elevation is decisive are low air pressure due to elevation, daylight rich in ultraviolet rays, thin and clear air, low temperature and low humidity. Low atmospheric pressure and lack of oxygen in mountainous regions have significant physiological effects, commonly called the mountain sickness. Although the mountains that fall into this category have a considerable height, there is no specific altitude that serves to categorize a high mountainous area. Depending on the climatic conditions, different spots can be considered as high mountainous areas although they may have different altitudes. For example, a mountain in Mexico can be considered a High Mountain if it is at an altitude of 4,000 meters above sea level. The high mountain zone limit is thought to be 1,700 meters above sea level in the north of Patagonia; It is thought to be between 2,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level in Spain. This ecosystem is characterized practically by constant strong winds. In addition, temperatures are low for most of the year and there is a constant presence of ice and snow. Temperatures are low throughout the year, due to the elevation. The Himalayas in Asia, the Rocky Mountains in North America, the Alps in Europe and the Andes in South America are typical regions.
