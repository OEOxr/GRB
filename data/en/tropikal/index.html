<div class="title"> Dry Tropical Forests (Deciduous)  </div>
<br/>
<div>
They are found to the north and south of the Equatorial rainforest as two zones located between 10-20 degrees northern and 20-30 degrees southern latitude. These plants have undergone modifications and adaptations according to the conditions of quite different regions such as plains of Mexico and Bolivia in South America, Pacific northwest coasts, Southwest Africa, India and Southeast Asia. The climate in which they are located is mild and warm all year round, with a long dry season and with little precipitation. Deciduous teak and ebony trees survive through the dry season by absorbing the moisture trapped on the forest floor by shed leaves. Thanks to the shade formed by trees on the floor, there are bushes with permanent and wide green leaves. In Southeast Asia and Sri-Lanka, these are forests with also continuously green and broad-leaved trees. These forests are home to very rich species of animals.

<div class="title">Dry Tropical Shrub and Grass Forest </div>
<br/>
<div>
They are green grass and shrubs spread over exceptionally large areas, found in Central and South America, India and Australia in areas where the average annual precipitation is less than 750 mm and the temperature averages at about 40°C during the warmer months. Plants are thorny and growth is slow. The maximum height of the trees is around 6 to 9 meters and they turn into very large pastures with monsoon rains. Shrub and grass forests with a very rich flora are the pasture areas of many species.

<div class="title">Dry Tropical Evergreen Forests   </div>
<br/>
<div>
They are tropical forests consisting of continuously green (evergreen) plants which do not shed their leaves, where the average annual rainfall is 1,000–1,500 mm and there is a long drought period. The reason they are able to remain continuously green is that the region consists of wetlands that feed on rivers. Best examples for this type of vegetation can be found at Cambodia, Thailand and at Vietnam, in low river basins and skirts of hills and in southern Laos at the Mekong River basin. These forests consist of very dense, almost unpassable shrubs, vines and large trees. They are home to thousands of different mammals such as Asian elephants, leopards, tigers, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, various monkey species and almost 500 species of birds.
