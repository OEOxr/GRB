<div class="title"> Savannahs</div>
<br/>
<div>
They are large grassland areas between tropical rainforests and deserts, where drought lasts a long time. Trees are rare near the tropics. It is the main vegetation of South and East Africa. Savannahs consisting of rootstalk plants and wheatgrass which can reach heights of nearly 2 meters can be regarded as the natural pastures of the earth. The vast meadows of North America and the steppes of the Asian continent are also pasture areas. These vast meadows are named “savannah” in the low precipitation areas of the tropical regions and “steppe” in the interiors of the continents. Very few single trees or small groups of trees are found in the savannahs that cover large areas. Due to the rainy summers, the pastures stay green throughout the summer. They are home to a considerable number and wide variety of animals, since these are the feeding and breeding areas of herbivorous species. They are also important habitats of many carnivorous predators and scavengers.
