<div>
Lake Eyre is Australia's lowest point (-15 m) and when completely full, becomes Australia's largest lake. It is named after Edward John Eyre, the European who observed the lake for the first time. There is a layer of salt at the deeper parts unique to the region, which is formed through the seasonal expansion of the lake followed by the evaporation of water. Even during the driest period, the area covered by Lake Eyre has water in the form of ponds. Usually, a depth of 1.5 m is seen every three years, 4 meters every 10 years, and complete fill several times within a century. By the end of the next summer, most of the water in the lake evaporates away. When water is present in the lake, the region becomes a breeding ground and habitat for many bird species.
