This is a 20 parallels wide vegetation belt in the northern regions of Northern Europe and Asia, as well as the northern parts of the American continent. They are forests of harsh winter climates that are characterized by continuous snow and frost. These trees with high commercial value due to their timber include fir, cedar, juniper, larch, spruce, pine, cypress and tamarack. Their wood is typically lightweight, their trunks are straight and their branches are sparse. Thanks to their leaves which are in the shape green needles, they make the most of the sun both in summer and winter, and they never shed their leaves.
