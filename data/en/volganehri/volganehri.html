<div class="title"> Volga River</div>
</br>
<div>
    The river, formerly known as Idil, is the longest river on the European continent with a length of about 3,500 km. It begins with the confluence of feeding streams from numerous lakes and marshes at the Valdai Hills between Moscow and St. Petersburg and it flows into the Caspian Sea 28 m below sea level. After Rjev, it becomes suitable for transportation. Once it joins the Moscow Canal, it reaches a width of about 250 meters with regular transportation from there on. The river, which freezes for three months during winter is used as a motorway and on its shores the most important ports and trade centers of Russia, such as Gorki, Kalinin, Kazan, Kuybyshev and Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) are located. The hydroelectric power plant built at the Volgograd Dam Reservoir is one of the most important industrial facilities in the world. There are five dams on the Volga River. At the point where Volga approaches the Don River for about 70 km, transportation is provided between the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea by means of a canal built between these two rivers. More than 200 branches are separated from the Volga within 50 km of the Caspian Sea, creating a delta more than 100 km in width. The Volga Basin, where a large part of Russiaâ€™s population lives, covers an area of 1,380,000 km2.
