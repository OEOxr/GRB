There are too many animals that feed on these lizards. In fact, the smaller a chameleon is, the more likely it is to be eaten by a larger animal. Among their predators are snakes, birds of prey and sometimes even monkeys. Although they are able to adapt well to their environment, they are near the bottom of the food chain. Chameleonâ€™s ability to blend into its environment by altering its skin color is a method of self defense whenever there is a predator in proximity. If this lizard is sitting on a branch, its skin can gain a color remarkably close to the color of the branch underneath. Most predators may in such case pass without noticing the animal sitting silently on the tree branch. Chameleons have excellent vision. They can see clearly up to a distance of 100 feet. This makes it easier for them to locate crickets, snails and other types of prey. They also have a full 360-degree panoramic view around their bodies. This special adaptation allows them to locate their food as well as predators much more effectively. Although they have excellent vision, their hearing is not that good. Like snakes, they can only hear sounds within a limited frequency range.
