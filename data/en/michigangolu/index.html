Lake Michigan is the only member of the Great Lakes that is entirely within USA territory. With a surface area of 58,000 km2, it is the largest lake in the world within the boundaries of a single country. There are 12 million people living in cities around Lake Michigan (majority in Chicago and Milwaukee), while small cities around the lake have seasonal population fluctuations due to tourism. Many species of fish and aquatic organisms live in the lake. Extreme fishing activities have damaged the ecosystem of the lake. In order to stabilize the ecosystem in the lake, human activities are restricted at times. The fish population is also endangered by invasive species such as lampreys and zebra mussels in the lake. Lake Michigan is considered the third coast of the USA because of its sandy beaches. In addition, there are many national, state owned and local parks around and within the lake. (Hydrologically, Lakes Michigan and Lake Huron share the same body of water and in scientific literature they are sometimes referred to as a single lake (Lake Michigan-Huron).
