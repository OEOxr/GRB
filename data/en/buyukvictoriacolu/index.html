<div class="title"> Great Victorian Desert</div>
<br/>
<div>
It is the largest desert on the Australian Continent, consisting of small dunes, herbaceous semi-shrubs and salt lakes. It is 700 km long from west to east and its total area is 424,500 km2. The Nullarbor Plain is located between the desert and the Great Australian Bight at the south. There is Simson Desert to the northeast, the Stuart Desert to the east and Gibson desert to the west. Annual precipitation is extremely low (200 mm) and variable, with 10-15 short downpours each year. In summer, the daytime temperature averages to 32 – 40°C and in winter the average drops to 18 – 23°C. Among large sand dunes small woodlands are found with plants that can tolerate the harsh conditions such as eucalyptus, shrubs and dry grass. Regarding the fauna, a wide variety of lizard species, small marsupial rodents burrowing in the sand, dingo which is a species of dog native to Australia, white-faced desert bird and large birds of prey are common, which are all adapted to the hot and arid desert conditions. The Great Victorian Desert is home to rare untouched pieces of land and Indigenous cultures on Earth. In the 1950s, because of Britain's nuclear weapon tests in the Maralinga and Emu regions, these regions are contaminated with radioactive pollution and no agriculture is possible within the desert but there are designated areas for the protection of nature and wildlife. Serious measures are being taken to protect wildlife in areas such as the Great Victorian Desert Reserve in the west and the Aborigine Regional Administration in the South. Today, many Indigenous tribes still live in the Great Victorian Desert.
