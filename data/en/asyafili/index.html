<div class="title"> Asian Elephant</div>
<br/>
<div>
These elephants have a finger-like extension at the tip of their trunks which allows them to collect items. Elephants are considered to be among the smartest animals, as they can use tools and display grief and compassion. They have more than 1000 muscles in their body. They are social animals that form maternal groups. These herds of female individuals can have up to 20 members. Elephants travel at dusk and dawn and roam around in the heat of the day. Elephants can communicate with each other using low-pitched sounds that humans cannot hear. These sounds can alert other elephants up to 10 km away. Asian elephants do not have tusks. Some males have smaller teeth called "tushes", but females do not have them at all. These species of elephants are found mostly in India and Southeast Asia.
