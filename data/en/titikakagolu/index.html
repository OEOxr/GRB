<div class="title"> Lake Titicaca </div>
</br>
<div>
	It is the largest freshwater lake in the South American Continent. The west coast belongs to Peru and the east coast belongs to Bolivia. It is 3,810 m above sea level and has a surface area of 8,288 km2. Its length is 195 km, its width is 65 km, the deepest point is at 280 m and the average depth is between 150 and 180 m.
	"Isla del Sol" (Island of the Sun) and “Isla de la Luna” (Island of the moon) are islands on the Bolivian part of the lake and they are considered to be sacred by locals. Both islands contain ancient relics from the Inca culture and traditional villages. Throughout history, the people of Lake Titicaca have made a living by fishing. For this end, the villagers build "floating islets" by knitting the fibers of a local plant called "totora". These artificial islands are unique in the world and exist only at Titicaca. The indigenous communities living on these islets, who even build small huts on them, are called "Uros". They live on these islands made for fishing purposes and maintain their traditional way of life, refusing to settle on land. Lake Titicaca is home to interesting lifestyles. On the island of Taquile, which is 5 km long and 1.5 km wide, a community of indigenous people with a population of 1,500 was discovered lately, because they were hiding from foreigners. Because the male population is accustomed to knitting, Taquile is also called the island of "knitting men". Commercial transportation between Bolivia and Peru also takes place at Titicaca Lake.
