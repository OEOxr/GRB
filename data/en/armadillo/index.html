<div>
Armadillos are almost exclusively native to Central America and South America. They live in meadows, rainforests, wetlands and semi-desert regions of America. Armadillo's most obvious feature, its hard scaly shell, provides armor protection against predators. The shell consists of overlapping scales, known as scutes. The armadillo can curl into its shell as a hard, protective ball! The scutes are made of keratin, a protein also found in human hair and nails. Giant armadillos have 100 teeth and six-inch claws. Armadillos also have a long tongue to suck their prey, hiding deep under the ground. A nine-banded armadillo can actually swim over the water, filling itself with enough air to float its body.
