<div class="title"> Sumatra Island</div>
<br/>
<div>
Sumatra is the largest island located entirely within Indonesia's borders. It is the sixth largest island in the world with an area of 473,482 kmÂ² and has a population of approximately 50 million. The island is divided into two geographical regions. The first is the Barisan Mountains in the west and the second is the swampy plains in the east. Mount Kerinci, the highest point of the Barisan Mountains, is an active volcano. The main reason of volcanic activity is the presence of Sumatra Island on the Pacific Ring of Fire. Although most of Sumatra used to be covered with tropical rainforests, they have largely disappeared due to political corruption. Sumatra is the largest producer of Indonesian coffee. The island is home to 17 endemic plant species and has 201 species of mammals and 580 bird species. The loss of half of the rainforest since 1985 has endangered many of the island's current species.
