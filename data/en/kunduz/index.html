<div>
Beaver collects a lot of material to build its unique and original dam. This engineering project usually takes place in the summer or early autumn, when beavers cut down trees and shrubs with their teeth and then move the material in their mouths to the place where their shelter is located. The purpose of the dam is to create a sustainable water environment in which they can build a shed. These elaborate homes serve as a kind of island fortress on the water. There is a central chamber and two underwater entrances secluded from the reach of predators. However, beavers do not build a dam on the water, yet prefer to live in a cave close to the edge for protection. Beavers are rarely seen during the day except twilight hours. They achieve almost every task at night, when predators are less likely to notice them. Unlike many other mammals, beavers do not hibernate, instead prepare for the scarce winter months by storing fats and food.
