<br/>
<div>
Erik the Red, a Norwegian exiled from his country had set sail in search of new land to settle. After a difficult journey he and his companions he reached a land with very harsh climate and geography which he later called Greenland and managed to start a community in 986. Soon life flourished in this region, and around the year 1000, Leif Eriksson, son of Erik the Red, and his crew sailing their way southwest from Greenland reached the east coast of America, landing in three separate regions they called Markland (today's Labrador), Helluland (Baffin Island) and Vinland (present-day New England). After spending the winter in Vinland, the crew returned to Greenland. Later, Eriksson's brother Thorvald and other kins had further efforts to colonize Vinland and settle there. However, they were not successful against the native tribes and returned to Greenland and settled in Iceland.
