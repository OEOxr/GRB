<div class="title"> Andes</div>
<div>
			The Andes, which constitutes the most magnificent and longest mountain system on earth, are home to many active volcanoes and glaciers, as well as peaks with 7,000 m altitude above sea level. This mountain system spans 7,500 km without interruption from tropical forests north of the Equatorial line to glaciers in the Antarctic region. The Andes, which run parallel to the west coast of the South American continent, form the most favored geographical features of territories of 7 countries including Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. At the 3,000-4,000 m high regions of the Andes mountain range, fertile highlands provide habitats suitable for people to dwell and settle. The Andes, stretching from north to south are divided into six sections: Venezuelan Cordilleras, Colombian Cordilleras, Ecuadorian Andes, Peruvian Andes, Central Andes and the Patagonian Andes.  The Andes range stretch south on a line that reaches the continent beginning from the Gulf of Panama, which encloses the Caribbean Sea at the west, and the Antilles, a collection of islands in eastern Central America at the northern hemisphere part of the tropical belt, in the form of three parallel mountain ranges. These three mountain groups are called the Western, Central and Eastern Cordilleras, which means a mountain chain in Spanish. These three separate arms merge before leaving Colombian territory and enter Ecuador as two rows.

			The Andes, which span across Ecuador without interruption, are home to Cotopaxi, currently the tallest active volcano (5,897 m) on earth within Ecuador's borders, before entering Peru. In Peru, the Andes get closer to the Pacific Ocean coast and it is called the Cordillera Della Costa (coastal chain). It gets 450 miles wide in Bolivia. With an altitude 4,000-5,000 m from the sea, the fertile soils of the Bolivian plateau accommodate hundreds of thousands of people. The highest point of the Andes, Mount Aconcagua (6,960 m), is located at the Central Andes. From Ecuador to the Uspallata Pass, east of Velgarasio in Chile, the lowest point is at 3,048 meters. Further south towards Patagonia, the Andes are divided into two parts. One arm heads from the Magellan Strait to the ice-covered islands of Tierre del Fuego (Land of Fire) assuming the name of Patagonian Andes. The other arm sinks into the ocean, forming the Patagonia Islands, a collection of thousands of islands, large and small, shaping the lower end of South America.

			The Ring of Fire
			Almost all of the volcanoes that constitute the South American section of the "Ring of Fire" which is an array of volcanos that encircle the Pacific Ocean, are located on top of the Andes mountain range. More than 70 of them are still active, although some of them are dormant or already extinct. Cotopaxi (5,897 m, Ecuador), Tungurahua (5,016 m, Ecuador), Pichincha (4,784 m, Ecuador), Villarrica (2,840 m, Chile) are among the most important active volcanoes. The Ring of Fire, with an open southern end follows the entire Pacific Ocean coasts. It originates at New Zealand; stretching to the north it covers Indonesia, Philippines, Japan and Kamchatka Peninsula before heading to the Rocky Mountains and through Central America, reaches the Andes to complete its path. If all the volcanoes on the circle had erupted at the same time, they would form a 15,000 km-wide ring of fire that would be easily visible from space.
