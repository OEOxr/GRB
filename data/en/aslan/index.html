	The scientific name for lion is "panthera leo". There are two types of lion subspecies. One is called "panthera leo melanochaita" and it dwells in South and East Africa. The second subspecies scientifically called "panther leo leo" dwells in West and Central Africa as well as Asia. Lions are usually social animals and their groups commonly called as “prides” consist 80% of females. Hence, only one out of eight male lions survives until adulthood. Troops of male lions occasionally gather to control large areas of land. A famous group of male lions in South Africa's Kruger National Park used to control 170,000 acres and were estimated to have killed more than one hundred rival lions and their cubs.
