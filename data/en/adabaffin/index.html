<br/>
<div>
Baffin Island is at the Nunavut territory of Canada and it is the largest island in the country. It's named after the British explorer William Baffin. Approximately 11,000 people live on the island, which is around 196,000 km² in size. The Hudson Strait separates the island from the province of Quebec at the south. On the northeast coast of the island lies the Baffin Mountains. On Baffin Island there are both permanently living animals, and some species which migrate to the island during summer. Some of the permanent animals on the island are arctic foxes, polar wolves and polar bears. The climate of the island is similar to that of eastern Canada, with very long winters and foggy, cloudy summers. The average temperature on the island is -8.5°C but in Reykjavik, which is located at approximately the same latitude, this value is around 5°C. The main reason for this difference is the incoming air current from the north, influencing the climate of Baffin Island.
