<div class="title"> Meadows</div>

<div>
It is vegetation found in the central parts of North America, Argentine pampas and south African steppes. In such meadows, Grasses grow more than 1 meter high. Before the Europeans arrived, the meadows of the North American continent looked like a green sea stretching from the end of the forest line of Pennsylvania and Ohio all the way to the Rocky Mountains, from the Mackenzie River in Canada to the Gulf of Mexico at the south, forming the largest patch of vegetation in the continent. They were the natural habitats and grazing fields of bisons and antelopes. Today, this area, covered with meadows, is divided into two main sections with a passage zone in between. The high grasslands stretch from the state of Ohio to eastern Oklahoma. The semi-barren plains to the east of the Rocky Mountains, where rainfall is low, are mostly covered with bison grass and blue poa. Between these two remote areas, summer poa, couch grass and short blue grass are common. In South America, grassland covered plains make up an area of 500,000 km2. At the western regions towards the Andes, due to a warm and dry climate, meadows turn into arid steppes. At the east, the climate is more humid thanks to the winds blowing from the Atlantic coast. Pampa climate is generally mild. In the eastern regions, the temperature difference between summer and winter is small due to proximity to the sea. In the west, the continental climate prevails. Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, where cattle breeding forms the basis of the national economy, benefit from pampas.
