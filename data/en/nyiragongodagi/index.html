Nyiragongo is an active volcano in Africa. It is located at Virunga National Park, within the territory of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The mountain is 3,470 m high, and it is located 20 km north of the city of Goma and Lake Kivu. Its main crater is a 2 km-wide lava lake. The crater has two separate lava steps, one higher at 3,175 m and the lower one at an altitude of 2,975. Together with the Nyamuragira volcano located very close by, most of the volcanic eruptions on the African continent have occurred in this region. It is thought to have erupted at least 35 times since 1882. Nyiragongo's lava chemistry is quite different, therefore its fluidity is very high, and it has been measured to flow with a speed of 100 km/h. The volcano stayed as an active lava lake between 1894 and 1977. In January 1977, as a result of the collapse of the crater walls, the lava lake began to flow down at a speed of about 100 km/h. About 70 villagers living on the upper slopes died, and some sources reported that casualties were over 1000 people. The lava lake in the Nyiragongo crater is unique in the world in terms of hazard potential due to its very fast flow and proximity to settlements. In the 2002 eruption, lava formed a river of 200 to 1,000 meters wide and 2 meters deep, destroying 4,500 homes reaching the city of Goma within hours, leaving 120,000 people homeless and 400,000 others seeking refuge in neighbouring Rwanda. Today, Nyiragongo volcano is still active.
