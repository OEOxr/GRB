<div class="title"> Discovery of the Poles</div>
<br/>
<div>
In August 1910 Norwegian explorer Amundsen set off to sail to the North Pole on Nansen's ship Fram. However, upon receiving the news that Peary had already arrived there, Amundsen and his team changed their destination and headed for the South Pole instead. This would put them in a competitive race with the British expedition team, who were on their way to the South Pole under Captain Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy mariner.

The Amundsen team arrived at the South Pole on 14 December 1911, moving faster than the British because their crew had a smaller number of people and therefore less and lighter equipment load. The British ship TerraNova had reached the Mc Murdo strait, where the base camp was, after a slow journey through the ice-covered sea. A lot of money was spent on the team's clothes and equipment, but wrong decisions were made. In these climatic conditions, it was impossible for horses to draw sleds who soon got stuck in the snow and died, whereas Amundsen used Eskimo outfits and sled dogs. When the British, drawing their sleds themselves instead of the lost horses, reached the Pole on January 18, they saw the Norwegian flag previously displayed by Amundsen and his team. Psychologically depressed, they tried to return home but they couldn't cope with the climatic conditions and died. .

  About eight months later, their frozen bodies were found by search teams.
  Amundsen became the first man to reach both poles in 1926 when he flew over the North Pole in a zeppelin called Norge.
