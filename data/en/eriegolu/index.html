<div class="title"> Lake Erie</div>
</br>
<div>
With a surface area of 25,745 km2, it is the fourth largest lake in the Great Lakes region of North America. Its deepest point is 64 m and its average depth is 19 m making it the shallowest among the Great Lakes, and therefore its average temperature is higher than other lakes. Lake Erie, fed by the Detroit River, connects via Niagara River to Lake Ontario. The official border between the USA and Canada passes through Lake Erie. It has 31 islands, 13 on Canadian and 18 on USA territory. Majority of these islands are located in the western part of the lake. Lake Erie's water replenishing period is 2.6 years. Due to waste spilled into Lake Erie, there is a eutrophication issue in certain areas of the lake, which means that the number of plants in the lake rapidly increases due to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution and this results with "dead" regions lacking oxygen. In fact, the lake was declared dead by the USA government in the early 1970s. Since then, there are efforts to control industrial activities and related wastes around the lake. Lake Erie, which contains 2% of the water volume of the Great Lakes, is home to 50% of the total fish population in the lakes. However, increasing amounts of algae is a serious threat to fish. In addition, invasive creatures such as certain mussel species that have arrived at the lake affect the ecosystem.
