<div>
It is believed that the blue whale is not only the largest animal species in the world, but also the largest creature that ever existed. Some are larger than 30 meters. In the last 100 years, their population have reduced greatly due to human hunting. Blue whales are found in both polar and tropical waters worldwide and migrate between the two regions at different times of the year. The sounds that blue whales produce are incredibly loud and they have been recorded in volumes above 180 decibels. This is the loudest sound by any living creature on the planet. Newborn blue whales are 7 meters long and weigh about 2.5 tons. Before weaning at the age of eight months, blue whale calves are known to consume up to 90 kg of milk every day. Just one breath from the blue whale produces enough air to fill about 2,000 balloons. Also, the heart of the blue whale is so big that it is the same size as a small car.
