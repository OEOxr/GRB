<div class="title"> Congo River</div>
</br>
<div>
With a length of 4,700 km, it is the second largest river on the African Continent after the Nile. It is located in Midwest Africa. The Congo River, which is the fifth longest river in the world, is also the river with the highest flow rate in the African continent and crosses the equatorial line twice. The Congo River, together with its tributaries, waters the world's second-largest rainforest after the Amazon. The total basin covers an area of 3,680,000 km2 and includes the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. On its opposite banks are Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the most modern cities on the African continent, and Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo. These two capitals, with only the Congo River as the border between them, are located in the region as the two closest capitals in the world. The Congo River, whose source is a merging of Lake Mveru, Lake Tanganyika and Lualaba River, flows into the Atlantic Ocean at the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the State of Angola.
