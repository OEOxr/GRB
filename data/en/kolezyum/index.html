<div class="title">Colosseum</div>
<br/>
<div>
  Also called The Flavian Amphitheatre, it is a large arena in Rome, the capital of Italy. It was built between 72 BC and 80 BC during the Titus period. In addition to gladiatorial fights organized to entertain the emperor and those around him and the public, the Colosseum also hosted events such as public performances, theatres and executions. It has also been used as shelter, bazaar and barracks at other points in history. The Colosseum, which has been a symbol of Rome and Italy since the Roman Empire, has been seriously damaged by stone theft and earthquakes throughout history, but remains the most visited place in Rome today. It is in the World Heritage List and it was also voted as one of the world's seven new wonders in 2007.
