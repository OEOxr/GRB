<br/>
<div>
  It was commissioned by Shah Jahan (1593-1666, the sixth ruler of the Turkish Mughal Empire, who ruled India for nearly 200 years from 1526 to 1700) in memory of his wife Ercumend Banu Begum, who died during childbirth. Construction began in 1632, one year after the wife's death. The architects of the Taj Mahal invited from Istanbul by Shah Cihan were Mehmet Isa Efendi and Mehmet Ismail Efendi as well as calligrapher Serdar Efendi, who was responsible for the calligraphy and decorations, all of whom were students of the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan. The Tomb section was completed in 1643 with the work of 20,000 workers under the supervision of numerous master builders. Located in a rectangular courtyard of approximately 177,000 mÂ² on the banks of the Yamuna River near Agra province, the Taj Mahal has a square footprint with 33 m high crown gates on four fronts, above which sits the dome at a height of approximately 50 meters with the 30 m high lower dome sheltering the interior. The structure which was built using white bright marble adorned with thin blue veins, has 4 minarets built with the same marble, and the entire surah of Yasin from the Quran is inscribed by Serdar Efendi on 4 sides of the building. The symbolic coffins of Shah Cihan and his wife Ercumend Banu Begum are under the dome at the upper floor and the interior is acoustically designed to reverberate sounds 7 times. The actual tombs are located at the lower floor. On the walls are adorned with hundreds of thousands of gemstones including agate, mother-of-pearl, turquoise and diamonds. The masterpiece, which everyone admires for its magnificent appearance, has inspired many artists from different nations. It is listed among The UNESCO World Heritage Sites and was voted by international participation as one of the seven new wonders of the world in 2007 by the Swiss-based "New 7 Wonders" foundation.
