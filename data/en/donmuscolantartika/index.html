In Antarctica, which is a mountainous continent, the Antarctic Peninsula is basically a large mountain range extending north, towards South America. It is an extension of the South American mountain range. Other mountain ranges cross Antarctica between the Weddel Sea and the Ross Sea. On the continent, where severe snowstorms are frequent, the average annual snowfall actually does not exceed 10-15cm and most of this small amount of snow evaporates. The snowstorms observed are in fact the existing snow being blown around. Among the mountains in the Victorian territory there are valleys with layers of salt above dry and snow-covered soil, similar to what happens at hot deserts. On the shores of the continent, the heat rises to the level of freezing. Soil is moist and it is not covered with snow in the summer, which makes the region rich in terms of flora and fauna.
