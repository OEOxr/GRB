Its powerful body, strong jaws and immense speed and agility, combined with its unparalleled stealth have made the crocodile one of the world's top predators in its natural habitat. Unlike other reptile species, crocodiles are archosaurs, an ancient branch of reptiles also including dinosaurs. Although dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, crocodiles are thought to have successfully survived over time because they were well adapted to their environment. Today there are 13 distinct species of crocodiles living in both fresh and saltwater environments in North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Their semiaquatic build has led to a number of critical adaptation improvements that have allowed them to survive efficiently in their natural habitat.
