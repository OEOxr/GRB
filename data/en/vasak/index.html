	They are typically solitary animals. These cats rarely roam and hunt in small groups. They usually live in dens carved into ledges or rocky crevices. The mother lynx raises her cubs in these dens. A lynx usually does not take its food to its den, unless it is a mother who must feed her offspring. These animals are very stealthy and tend to avoid human settlements, therefore they are rarely seen. Although these wild cats usually hunt on land, they are completely skilled at climbing trees and swimming. The Eurasian lynx lives in central and northern Europe and near Mount Damavand in India, northern Pakistan and Iran. This species is most commonly found in northern European countries such as Norway, Finland and Sweden, and in most of Russia.
