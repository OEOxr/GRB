	The desert climate is also known as the arid climate. The vegetation typical to this type of climate is mostly shrubs and dry grass. Precipitation is extremely rare and another type of desert climate is polar climate. There is either no precipitation at all or it is very rare. The land is not fertile in this climate. Therefore, no vegetables, plants or fruits grow.  Since there is no precipitation, the humidity is extremely low. Therefore, the daily temperature differences between day and night are also quite high. In the desert climate, annual precipitation is less than 200 mm. Desert regions are usually surrounded by high mountains. In the desert climate, it is very dry in summer and quite cold in winter. Vegetation is sparse. In the regions where there is some water, small herbivorous plants grow. Apart from oases, the desert climate is not suitable for human settlement. Physical erosion of rocks and large sand formations are common in the desert climate.
