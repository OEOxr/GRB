<div class="title"> Galapagos Islands</div>
<br/>
<div>
This is an archipelago of Ecuador 1,000 km west of the South American continent on the Pacific Ocean, with a total area of 50,000 km2. It consists of 14 large, 8 small and 40 even smaller islets. There are many volcanoes still active on the islands. The general geographical character is steep and rugged terrain formed by volcanoes, with craters and deep valleys. The volcanic islands formed by layers of lava accumulated over long periods of time are now home to many biological species specific to this region alone. These species which were featured in Charles Darwinâ€™s famous theory of evolution are the main reason why scientists visit the islands today. The region gained worldwide fame after Charles Darwin's visit to the islands in 1835 and Galapagos archipelago is now on the world heritage list of islands and attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year.
