It is a volcano that is identified with the Karakatau island, located between Sumatra and Java in Indonesia. The mountain occupies a large part of this island. In 1883, its eruption equivalent to hundreds of nuclear bombs was heard from a distance of 5,000 km and had a major impact on the earth. Waves reaching a height of 40 meters caused by the power of the explosion were the first case of tsunami in the Indian Sea. 35,000 people died and nearly 300 settlements were destroyed. Giant clouds of volcanic ash accumulated at an altitude of 80 km in the atmosphere depriving the region from sunshine for years. The eruption also caused a 2°C drop in the earth’s atmospheric average temperature.
