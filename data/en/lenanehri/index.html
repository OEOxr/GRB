<div class="title"> Lena River</div>
</br>
<div>
It is the 10th longest river on Earth with a total length of approximately 4,500 km. Lena, whose basin area is 2,490,000 km2, is covered with ice for more than half of the year. Its source is at the Baikal mountains at an altitude of 1,600 meters, about 20 km west of Lake Baikal. Near the source, Vitim River carries 2,000 m3 of water per second from the east and Olekma River delivers almost the same amount of water from the west. Other major branches are Aldan with a contribution of 5,200 m3/s and Villuy with 2,500 m3/s. After merging with the Aldan River, Lena is intercepted by the Verkhoyansk Mountain Range heading northwest. Following the foothills of the mountain range the course of the river continues towards the north through taiga and tundra. At this region Vilyuysk, one of its most important branches joins Lena from the left bank. The most notable settlement on the banks of the river is the city of Yakutsk. The Lena River, which forms a very, very large delta at the end of the Verkhoyansk Mountain Range, completes its journey by flowing into the Laptev Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean.
