		People tend to make a quick decision about hyenas and regard them as fierce carnivores with an evil laughter, but that is a rather unfair description. In reality, they are social and intelligent animals. Contrary to widespread belief, hyenas have more in common with cats than dogs. They play a vital role in the ecosystems of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. They are in great competition with lions. In 1999, lions and hyenas at Ethiopia's Gobele wilderness started a battle. The situation eventually got so deadly that the army had to interfere. In the end, 35 hyenas and 6 lions were killed.
