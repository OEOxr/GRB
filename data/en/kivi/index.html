The flightless kiwi, the national symbol of New Zealand, is among the most remarkable birds in the world. It is a bird that lives in forests, preferring tall bushes or steep and wet areas surrounded by trees. Kiwis never build nests. Instead, they dig burrows in the ground with their sharp claws. The kiwi has a lower body temperature than any other known bird. It feeds all night, from dusk to dawn. With its highly developed sense of smell, the kiwi finds its prey and then uses highly developed sensory tissues at the tip of its long beak to catch it. Its diet consists of worms, maggots, fruits and seeds. Although a Kiwi is almost the same size as a chicken, its egg is six times bigger than a chicken egg. The life span of a kiwi is 25 to 50 years.
