<div>
Lake Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America with an area of 8,264 kmÂ², reaches 26 meters at its deepest point. Although it is a tectonic freshwater lake, sawfish, sharks and tarpons live in the lake. Although initially researchers thought that the lake shark was an endemic species, findings in the 1960s showed that the shark had actually reached the lake via Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River, which in turn connects to the Caribbean Sea. Apart from these fish, at least 16 endemic cichlid species live in the lake. However, one non-native cichlid species, tilapia, poses a potential danger to the ecosystem due to the considerable amounts of waste it produces and the types of diseases it introduces into the system that other cichlid species are not immune to. The lake includes the volcanic islands of Ometepe and Zapatera and the Solantiname Archipelago. There are periodically very strong storms in the lake that hinder transportation. Moreover, intense winds in the direction of the Pacific Ocean create large waves in the lake. Environmental research in Lake Nicaragua over the past 40 years has shown that the water in the lake is heavily contaminated. It is estimated that approximately 32 tons of sewage waste was discharged into the lake every day during the research period.
