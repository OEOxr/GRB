  Together with its Angara and Selenga branches, Yenisey travels 5,540 km, ranking the fifth longest river in the world and the largest river system flowing into the Arctic Ocean. It begins from the mountains of Mongolia and irrigating a large part of Siberia, flows into the Kara Sea at the Arctic Ocean. Yenisey river has a significant place in Turkish history. Throughout history many Turkish and Mongolian states have been flourished on the banks of this river. In the old Kyrgyz language, Yenisey is spelled "Ene-Say". While "ene" means mother, "say" means river. Tuva Turks call it Ulug-Hem meaning the Great River. Kyzyl City, the capital of the Turkic Republic of Tuva, is located on the banks of the river and accommodates ships arriving for ecotourism and regular passenger transport. The basin of the Yenisey river covers an area of 2,580,000 km2.
