<div class="title">Harsh (Arid, Severe) Continental Climate</div>
<br/>
<div>
	It is the type of climate that is effective in high latitudes of the Central Belt (Siberia, Canada, Norway, etc.) and in high mountainous areas. The average temperature is between 0°C and 10°C and the annual temperature difference is between 20°C and 40°C. This is the type of climate with the highest annual temperature differences. Winter is long, harsh and cold, summer is short and cool. Rain is in the form of convectional precipitation during the summer. The average annual precipitation is around 500-600 mm and it is not evenly distributed along the year. Most of the precipitation falls at the beginning of summer, the least in winter. Natural vegetation are taigas of cold-tolerant coniferous trees and forests called boreals, and tall meadows that flourish with summer rains. Verhoyansk city in Siberia, where temperatures are 10-15 °C in summer and -30 - -40°C in winter, is the point where the annual temperature difference is the highest on earth (59°C).
