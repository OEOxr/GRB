With a total area of 103,000 km2, most of Iceland consists of active volcanoes with a total number of almost 200. The most important one is the Hekla Volcano, which has a height of 1,490 m. It is located 110 km east of the city of Reykjavik. It was named "Hell's Gate" by the locals during the Middle Ages. The Hekla Volcano, which is ready to erupt at any moment, has been active every 10 years during the last 50 years. It erupted about 20 times in the last 1,000 years, the last time in February 2000. The Eyjafjoel volcano, which erupted in 2010 and had a very negative impact on European air transportation, is located very close to the Hekla volcano. Following these two recent eruptions in Iceland, geologists in the country predict that the volcanoes have entered an active period and new eruptions are expected.
