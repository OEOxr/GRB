<div class="title"> African Coast and Cape of Good Hope</div>
<br/>

  The first expedition around the African continent was conducted by the Egyptians around 600 BC. It took 2,000 years before anyone else could attempt to do the same.
  The main purpose of the journey was to find an alternative sea route around Africa to avoid the Turks and to establish direct contact with India, since the trade routes between East and West, namely The Silk Road, for importing luxury goods such as silk, sugar, spices, gemstones and pearls from the east, novelties for the Europeans of the Middle Ages, were controlled by the Turks. A new trade route would mean more profitable access to Far Eastern goods.

  In 1487, King Joao II of Portugal commissioned three ships under the command of Bartolomeo Dias to navigate around the southern tip of Africa. Approaching Cape Volta, the sailors found themselves in a storm that swept them all the way into the Indian Ocean. The sailors, who were drifted to Cape Great Fish in the north, wanted to go back to their homes, but on the way back they noticed the Cape. The explorers named the cape “Cabo das Tormentas”, meaning Cape of Storms; but King Joao later converted it to “Cape of Good Hope”.
