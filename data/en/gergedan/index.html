<div>
  The largest rhinoceros native to Asia is the Indian rhino with a habitat that extends to the foothills of the Indian subcontinent. The Indian rhino has a distinctive appearance with its unicorn and tough skin which looks like a body armor.
  The Sumatran rhinoceros, once roaming in a large area from India to the island of Borneo, is critically endangered today and is found only in a few isolated pockets deep in the forest. Sumatran rhinos are known for their prehistoric appearance with hair that cover their entire body. The Javan rhino, which once roamed southeast Asia, is now limited to a single nature reserve in Indonesia called Ujung Kulon National Park.
  Rhinos often have a lonely lifestyle. Although African black rhinos defend their territory aggressively, Indian and Javan rhinos have loosely defined regions that can overlap. Living in denser forests and vegetation, Sumatran rhinos are accurate in marking their paths with feces and urine.
