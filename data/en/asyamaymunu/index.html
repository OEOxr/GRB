<div class="title"> Asian Monkey (Gibbon)</div>
<br/>
<div>
They spend most of their lives in the canopies of the rainforest, up in the air, at treetops. They land at the forest floor from time to time. All species of Asian monkeys are loud. Their voices are musical and can reach long distances. They use their voices to locate other monkeys, to alert intruders and to impress their mates. The mating song, which is usually a duet with the intended partner, is known as the big call. They live in small, nuclear families consisting of a couple and an infant. Although these animals sleep in trees, they do not nest like other monkeys. When the young one matures, it departs to create its own family.
