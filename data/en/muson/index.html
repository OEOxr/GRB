It is vegetation found in Asia unique to the southern, southeastern and eastern regions where tropical climate characteristics prevail. The average annual rainfall is around 1,000-1,500 mm at the interiors of this region, where summer is warm and continuously rainy, and winters are dry and cold. In coastal areas, amount of rainfall is much higher and it may reach 12,000 mm per year at the northeast coast of India. Broad-leaved teak trees, which shed their leaves in winter, constitute the most common plant. These trees are highly tolerant to excessive humidity and water in summer and drought in winter. Teak has continuously green, leathery and flocked green leaves. Under the teak trees, on the forest floor there are ferns, epiphytes (air plants) and climbers.
