<div>
  With its huge head, huge horns and furry coat, the bison is the largest mammal in North America. However, the bison can reach speeds of up to 60 km/h! In cold weather, the bison has long and hairy coat. Those living in warm climates have shorter hair. Sometimes bisons are peaceful and lazy. At other times, they can be aggressive and dangerous without warning. Female flocks are usually larger than males and they have a maternal decision-making process such as where to graze and when to sleep. American bisons are nomadic vegetarians.
