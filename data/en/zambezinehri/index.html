<div>
Zambezi River is born at the Zaire, Zambia and Angola border, at an altitude of 1,600 meters in the south of the African Continent. It marks the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe with a 1,240,000 km2 basin, spans 800 km in Mozambique and flows into the Indian Ocean after passing through an "S" shaped valley. On its course, there are many rapids and falls, the most famous of which is Victoria Falls, pouring from an altitude of 108 meters. Zambezi flows between Zaire and Zimbabwe for another 700 km. The most important facilities on the river are the Kariba Dam, which meets the needs of the city of Copperbelt in Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the Cabora Bassa dam in Mozambique, where most of its electricity is sold to South Africa. After this region, the river crosses the Lupata strait and flows into the Mozambique Plain and expands to a width of 5 to 8 km. Near Vila Fontes, it merges with the Shire River to flood a wide, flat and swampy delta. Small ships navigate at a 2,500 km long section of the river. Indigenous peoples such as Lozis, Shonas, Tongas, Chewas, Nsengas live around the Zambezi River. It is the fourth largest river on the African Continent.
