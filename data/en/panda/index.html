Panda is a species of bear found in the mountains of central and western China. Panda, one of the most famous and easily identified animals in the world, is also one of the rarest and it is under great threat in its natural environment, especially due to habitat loss. Pandas are unique among bears, as they do not hibernate, have very small babies at birth and have an almost entirely vegetarian diet. Since the Giant Panda was first discovered by a French naturalist in 1869, it has become a global symbol of conservation, currently used as the logo of the World Wildlife Fund. Historically, pandas used to roam the plains of the Yangtze River Basin but increased human activity in the region pushed pandas to the high mountains. Pandas eat a lot of bamboo and because bamboo is not particularly nutritious, a panda can consume up to 30 kg of bamboo leaves, shoots and stems, which is about 40% of its body weight. That is why pandas devote 12 to 15 hours of their time in a day to eating bamboo, which they do while sitting, allowing their front paws to cling to the plants. Pandas seem to spend all day eating or sleeping, but they are also known to be good at climbing trees and swimming when necessary.
