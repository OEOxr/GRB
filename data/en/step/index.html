Semi-arid climate defines areas with low precipitation, usually between 250–500 mm to 10–20 mm on average annually. In the Asian continent, they stretch between Taiga forests in the north and by deserts in the south, consisting of treeless pastures from Eastern Europe to the east of Asia. The southern border of the Sahara Desert in Africa, Karoo and Kalahari in South Africa to the west of Botswana, the interiors of the western region in North America, northeastern California, northeast of Brazil and the Patagonia steppes in South America, the circumference of the central desert region in Australia, most of Pakistan and the steppes in central, eastern and southeast Anatolia in Turkey are typical examples. In the steppe belt, dry but not too hot summers are followed by very cold winters. Depending on the duration of the drought, many plant species grow, from short herbs of a few centimeters height to plants with tubers and bulbs. Hoofed animals such as antelopes and deers come to graze, helping plant seeds to be buried in the soil and useless weed patches to be removed, making room for new plants. Burrowing rodents, the real owners of the steppes, build their homes deep in the soil, bringing together soil varieties that otherwise have no connection with the surface soil which thereby becomes enriched. In the spring, revived by the melting of the snow, the steppe turns into a large sea of grass. In addition to flowers such as mountain tulips, red poppies, and iris, other plants with thin foliage that are able to tolerate the climate are common. Wheat farming is carried out in suitable steppes all around the world.
