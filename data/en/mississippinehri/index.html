<div class="title"> Mississippi River</div>
<div>
It is the fourth largest river in the world after Nile, Amazon and Yangtze rivers. It was named by the Ojibwe Indians, by combining the words "Missi" and "Sippi", which means "great river" in their language. It is the longest river in the North American Continent with 3,733 km; combined with its branches Missouri and Jefferson rivers it reaches 6,275 km in length. Its source is Lake Itaska, located in the north of the state of Minnesota. Its basin measures 3,220,000 km2 and it has around 250 branches, the most important of which are Missouri, Ohio, Arkansas, Red River and Des Moines. In addition to its agricultural benefits, Mississippi is the busiest commercial waterway in the world, with heavy transportation traffic in about 50 of its branches. Crude oil and petroleum products, iron, steel and coal are the main products transported. The Mississippi River, by its nature, causes floods at times. Floods in 1929 and 1937 caused extensive damage, and although secondary canals, pumping stations and dams were built to prevent flooding, 400 million tons of fertile soil are piled up each year in the delta that forms its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico.
