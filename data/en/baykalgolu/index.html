<div class="title"> Lake Baikal</div>
</br>
<div>
It is located within Russian territory, in the southeast of Siberia. It has been formed in a depression sinkhole about 25 million years ago and it is the deepest lake in the world with a depth of 1,620 meters. It is also the largest freshwater reserve on earth. Lake Baikal stretches between mountain ranges in the form of a circular arc with a very large diameter, with peaks exceeding 2,500 m. The lake water, fed by more than 300 rivers is remarkably pure and clean, therefore it is rich in terms of flora and fauna. Endemic fish species are found in the lake, however certain species of fish are under threat of extinction due to excessive fishing, therefore Lake Baikal has been protected by laws.
