Kangaroos are found only in Australia, Tasmania and the surrounding islands. The kangaroo is one of the most remarkable jumpers in the animal kingdom. While on the go, it can leap forward up to 9 meters with a single quick jump! The kangaroo's diet consists largely of grass, shrubs and many different types of flowering plants. Dingoes, feral cats, foxes and other predators sometimes feed on joeys (baby kangaroos) or dead kangaroos. Kangaroos are the largest marsupials in the world. Depending on the species, an adult kangaroo is approximately 3 to 7 meters tall and weighs between 40 to 200 kilos. The kangaroo is a highly social animal that likes to gather in groups of 10 to 100 individuals, known as mobs, courts or troupes. They have a male-only boxing competition to figure out who will have access to females. During the fight, males lock their arms, push their rivals and kick each other while balancing on their tails. Joeys are born after only a month of gestation and crawl into their mothersâ€™ pouch and remain there for 120-400 days before climbing out as a young kangaroo.
