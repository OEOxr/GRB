</br>
<div>
It is the third largest lake in the Great Rift Valley and the ninth largest lake on earth, with a surface area of 29,604 km2, its depth reaches 700 m in places and its average width is 560 km. Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique are countries which share the lakeâ€™s coasts. Vast beaches at the south coast are very popular, while the steep slopes of the Livingstone Mountains at the northern coast of Tanzania stand like giant walls. Intense winds and big waves are typical in this region. Malawi lake is very rich in terms of fauna. There are 1,500 species of aquarium fish alone, the best-known being Cichlid, which carries its babies in its mouth for protection. In Lake Malawi, edible fish as an export product also exist. Cargo and passenger transportation is available by various ships between Monkey Bay Port in the south and Kambve port in Karonga City at the north. The journey across the lake takes 2.5 days. Malawi lake, which has exceptionally clean and clear waters, is also home to hippopotamuses. On small islands where people do not settle, wildlife continues in all its pureness. The lake, which is now protected as part of Malawi National Park, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
