<div>
  During the early 15th century, the new Chinese Emperor Zhu Di assigned a fleet of 317 ships and about 25,000 people to the command of Zheng He, a high-level palace official, to conduct expeditions to other countries. With this fleet, completing seven major voyages between 1405 and 1433 Zheng He explored Sumatra, Thailand (Siam), Borneo, the Maldives Islands, the Persian Gulf and the eastern coast of Africa. A Chinese map dating back to 1420 depicts the west African coast in detail, suggesting that the Chinese had sailed past the Cape of Good Hope in a westbound route 60 years before Portuguese Bartolomeu Dias.
  Two years after the return of Zheng He, the expeditions had to end due to the death of the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty.
