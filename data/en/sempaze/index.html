Chimpanzees are a species of ape that is native to various habitats located in Western and Central Africa. The chimpanzee, which is a close relative of other apes including orangutans and gorillas, is also very closely related to humans, as we share 98% of DNA composition. They are considered to be the smartest animals on the planet after humans and they not only display emotion but are also excellent problem solvers. They are also known to make tools that help them survive. There are two different species of chimpanzees: the common chimpanzee and the smaller bonobo (also known as the dwarf chimpanzee), the latter having a limited distribution south of the Congo River. However, despite being extremely peaceful and intelligent creatures, chimpanzees are seriously under threat in their natural habitats today, mainly due to hunting for bushmeat and deforestation.
