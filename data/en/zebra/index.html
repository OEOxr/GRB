Zebra is a large species of horse native to the grassy plains of sub-Saharan Africa. Zebras are extraordinarily sociable animals that can travel long distances in search of fresh grass and water, but they are currently under serious threat in most of their natural habitats due to increased levels of human activity. Their strong social bonds can make them extremely considerate, often grooming each other using their teeth. The stripes on the coats of zebras dazzle predators who want to hunt them, as when zebras run in packs, the attacker is unable to focus on a single individual.
