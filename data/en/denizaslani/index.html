<br/>
<div>
  Living in various climates in both the northern and southern hemispheres, the sea lion is one of the largest animals in New Zealand. Sea lions can dive deep, walk on all fours and love to have fun and play! They are smart animals. They can interpret sign language and some even serve in the U.S. Navy to assist in counter-espionage missions! Sea lions are great divers and can stay underwater for up to nine minutes at a time. And they can dive very deep. Sea lions are primarily carnivores, that is, they mostly eat meat. However, sometimes they eat marine plants and seaweed as well.
