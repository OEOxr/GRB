	<br/>
	<div>
It is located at the south of Washington State in the USA, and It is 2,549 m high. It is part of the Cascade Mountain Range which in turn is located on the north American section of the "Pacific Ring of Fire", a chain of volcanoes that stretch along the west coast of the North American Continent. St. Helens is still active today. It remained dormant from 1857 to 1980, and erupted on May 18, 1980, destroying the western peak. As a result, its height dropped from 2,950 m to 2549 m after the explosion. In the same eruption, 57 people were killed while making gas measurements. Ash and gas clouds formed at an altitude of 18 km, reaching the stratosphere, and the volcano's ash discharge lasted for nine hours. Between 1980 and 1986, the volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens continued with numerous minor eruptions.
