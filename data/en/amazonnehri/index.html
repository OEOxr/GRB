<div class="title"> Amazon River</div>
</br>
<div>
Located in the South American continent, mostly flowing through Brazilian territory, Amazon is the second longest river in the world and it is a combination of streams that collect the waters of an area equal to 7 times that of Turkey. The Amazon River, which reaches a width of 10 km in the lower reaches, is born at the peaks of the Andes mountains in Peru, flows to the east and reaches a width of 240 km on the shores where it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The Amazon with a length of 6,400 km, carries more water than Yangtze, Nile and Mississippi rivers combined and it accounts for 25% of the water carried by all of the world's rivers. The Amazon River ranks first in terms of annual average flow rate with a figure of about 180,000 m3/s and the immense size of the Amazon Basin, the area it irrigates. The reason it is so large is because of the Amazon Rainforests that make up its basin. The Amazon Basin, which still has unexplored regions, is home to small indigenous tribes that live off hunting and gathering, unaware of the outside world. Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela are the countries in the basin.
