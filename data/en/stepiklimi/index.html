	Steppe climate, which is seen in the interiors of the Central Belt regions, is common at the interiors of Anatolia, Central Asia, central parts of North America and the Iranian Plateau. It is most common in the inner land sections of warm or temperate belts. Precipitation usually falls during the spring season. The summer months are quite dry, so the general vegetation is in the form of steppes. It is considered as a transition climate. The differences between the average annual temperatures are high. Summers are hot, winters are cold. On average, the annual temperature can vary between 10-13째C. The difference in the average annual temperature can vary between 20-30째C. Natural vegetation is seen as steppes. In other words, grass patches that grow with the spring rainfall and dry out in summer are the main type of vegetation. The steppe climate is much more humid compared to the desert climate with which it is therefore not comparable. The fact that it prevails at regions near the Mediterranean causes high levels of rainfall in the spring season. In January, the temperature can drop to 1째C. In July, the temperature can rise to 26-27째C. This is the general characteristics and structure of the climate.
	It is among the climate types seen in Turkey. In Turkey, it is more prevalent in the interiors of the Anatolian Peninsula. It is also seen in Central Asia, parts of Iran, and in the central areas of the North American Continent. Steppe climate can be seen in some parts of the regions close to the Mediterranean climate. In general, steppe climate is found at the interiors of warm lands.
