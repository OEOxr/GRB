<div>
	Atacama is the driest desert on earth, located to the north of Chile in the South American Continent. The Pacific Ocean and coastal mountain ranges stretch at its west. It is further surrounded by Peru at the north, Bolivia, Argentina and the high plateau of Puna de Atacama at the east. Major settlements are Tocopilla, Antofagasta and Chanaral, which are found along the Pacific Ocean coastline. Nitrate, iron and especially copper mines are located in this region. The total area of the Atacama Desert is 78,268 km2 and the population is approximately 200,000. The name Atacama represents a large cultural area formed in many historical periods. The desert is a particularly important archaeological site where tools made from bones and stones dating back to 4000 BC were found. Later, mummies of children, as well as wooden weapons, fishing hooks, woven products and baskets from around 3000 BC have been excavated. Fishing is believed to be the primary survival strategy of the local community at that time.
	The dry slopes of the Andes mountain range overlook the Atacama Desert which is therefore subject to extremely dry eastern winds. The desert receives rainfall every 10 years, after which a brief ecological revival take place. Due to Humboldt Current, the cold-water flow in the Pacific Ocean, near the coast of South America, very few rain clouds form at the region. Due to this natural phenomenon, the Atacama Desert has a quite different climatic character from the rest of the region in which it is located. Atacama is a cold desert at places due to Humboldt. In the coastal areas, a layer of fog specific to this part of the terrain is usually present. A unique “fog catcher” system allows water to be obtained from the moisture of this fog. Due to the unique atmospheric characteristics, there are many observatories in the mountainous parts of Atacama. The desert is estimated to be 15 million years old and it constitutes the basis of Chile's economy with its nitrate and rich silver mines, as well as copper and gold reserves.
