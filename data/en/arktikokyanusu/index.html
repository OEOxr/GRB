		The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the five Oceans that exist on Earth (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and recently separated Southern Ocean). It is a body of water covered with glaciers to the north Europe, Asia and North America, mostly north of the Arctic Circle between 90Â° northern latitude. Approximately 1.5 times the size of the USA and with a total surface area of 14,056,000 km2, the Ocean includes the Baffin Bay, the Barents Sea, the Beaufort Sea, the Chukchi Sea, the East Siberian Sea, the Greenland Sea, the Hudson Bay, the Hudson Strait, the Black Sea, the Laptev Sea, the Northwest Passage and other branches of water. The Ocean is shallow compared to other oceans and its deepest point is the Lena Trench (5,4449 m).  It has a total coastline of 45,389 km with Russia, USA, Canada, Greenland and Russia combined. The average depth is 1,038 m. Continental platforms stretch along the coasts of Russia and Alaska. In these regions, extensions of Siberian shields and The Pacific Ocean mountain ranges are seen. On the shores of Canada and Greenland and the Scandinavian peninsula, the platform's narrower surface forms become more pronounced with deep depressions. Northwest Passage (USA and Canada) and North Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two critical seasonal waterways.
