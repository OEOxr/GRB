	Between the Americas, Asia, Australia and Antarctica, it is the largest ocean in the world with a surface area of 166,000,000 km2, reaching 180,130,000 km2 together with coastal seas (Bali Sea, Bering Strait, Bering Sea, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Philippine Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea). The Pacific Ocean, which contains the deepest marine pits and spans almost a third of the world, accounts for half of the total surface measurement of all oceans. The longest distances on the Pacific Ocean, which has a water volume of 708,000,000 km3, are 16,000 km in the north-south direction, and 17,000 km in the east-west direction. Its average depth is around 4,000 m. The mountain ranges at the ocean floor often rise in pointed peaks, creating deep pits between them as they approach the surface. Examples of the deepest measurable pits are the Aleut Pit (7,822 m), the Board Pit (10,542 m) the Japanese Pit (10,230 m), the Marianne Pit (10,924 m), and the deepest of them all, Philippine Pit with a depth of 11,521 m.
	There are two large currents in the Pacific Ocean. One flows clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and the other flows in the southern hemisphere in the opposite direction. The Kuroshio and Oyashio currents in the northern hemisphere, and the Southern Equatorial current, the Eastern Australian current and the Peruvian or Humboldt currents in the southern hemisphere, are the major currents. Salinity and seawater temperatures vary by region in the Pacific Ocean. Highest salinity values are at tropical regions. Surrounded by young mountain ranges that make up the Ring of Fire and the volcanoes on it, the Pacific Ocean has an impressive topography with the Southeast Ridge, Antarctic Ridge and Eastern Pacific Rise, which are extensions of the Indian Ocean Ridge.
