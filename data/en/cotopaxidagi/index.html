<div class="title"> Cotopaxi (Ecuador)</div>
<br/>
<div>
It is located in Ecuador, 30 miles south of the capital Quito, within the boundaries of the national park named after itself. It is one of the highest active volcanoes in the world. Ecuador's highest mountain is Chimborazo with 6,310 meters, but it is no longer active. Cotopaxi is a typical stratovolcano with its smooth conical shape and its peak with an ice cap. The mouth diameter of the summit crater is approximately 800 m and its depth is around 350 m. It has exploded 50 times since 1738, and when the peak glaciers melted in 1877, resulting muddy avalanche caused many floods and the city of Latacunga was completely destroyed. Its most recent activities were recorded between 1975-76. Although it is still an active volcano, Cotopaxi is the most visited peak in South America and the most climbed mountain in Ecuador. Today, regular climbs are carried out under the guidance of local tourism companies.
