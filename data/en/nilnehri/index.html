<div class="title"> Nile River</div>
</br>
<div>
With a length of 6,650 km, it is the longest river in the world. By flowing through more than half of the African Continent from south to north, Egypt forms the fertile Nile delta in Cairo and flows from Alexandria and Damietta into the Mediterranean. Nile is born as the Kagera River in the East African Great Lakes Region in Burundi. Initially marking the Uganda border, it completes its journey by crossing the territories of South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. Countries in its basin are Egypt, Sudan, Burundi, Rwanda, Congo, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, constituting a total basin area of 3,400,000 km2. The width of its mouth where it flows into the Mediterranean Sea is about 300 km. It can be divided into 8 geographical regions from south to north. The water, which originate in the East African Great Lakes region in the far south, form the main branches of the White Nile, some of which pass through Lake Victoria and some flow in and out of Lake Mobotu before merging in the Kabalega Falls in Uganda. Near the Sudan-Uganda border, where the river is called Bahrulcebel (Mountain River) the second region begins and extends about 150 km north of the river, entering the third area in the low swampy plain called Sudd and renamed the "White Nile" at the north of Sudd. The White Nile, which provides 30% of the total water volume of the Nile, flows further for 800km as the Blue Nile and Atbara rivers, which constitute the fourth and fifth regions through the Ethiopian highlands and Tana Lake. The sixth region starts in Khartoum, where the river flows into the Aswan Dam in southern Egypt. This stream of 1800 km so far draws an "S" curve and is interrupted by 6 cascades. Located at the edge of the first waterfall, the Aswan Dam in the city of Aswan, forms the Nasir Lake, one of the largest artificial lakes in the world. The damâ€™s construction was completed in 1971. The seventh region, located between Aswan and the Nile delta, waters farm areas along the riverbanks for 725 km. The economy in this region has been dependent on the Nile ever since the ancient Egyptian Civilization 6,000 years ago. The first dams were built in 1861 both for irrigation and for electric power, expanding agricultural land immediately by 20%. The eighth region is the Nile delta, which is 160 km long and consists of fertile sediments that have accumulated over thousands of years.
