<div class="title">Tundra and Arctic Climate</div>
<br/>
<div>
	This is the type of climate seen at the North Polar Circle and in South America. Winter is quite long and the harsh while the summer is cool and short. No variation is observed in the soil and vegetation. The type of climate in which most of the land is swampy and frozen is called the tundra climate. The annual temperature difference is 60째C. During the warmest month of the year, temperature does not exceed 10째C. In winter, temperatures range between -30째C to -45째C s. In the tundra climate, precipitation varies from 200 to 250 mm per year. Additional precipitation is in the form of snow. No plants grow in the soil because it is frozen throughout the year. In summer, the upper part of the frozen soil thaws. Thus, swamps appear in places. The vegetation of the tundra climate is made up of dwarf shrubs, mosses, and lichens. Meadows are made up of tundra plants.  Fishing is common since agriculture is not an option for the local people in this climate. The region receives almost no rainfall in winter. Most of the precipitation occurs during summer. In regions dominated by the tundra climate, economic activities are usually limited. This leads to a an extremely low population density in this region. The angle of incidence of the sun's rays is very low. This is the reason why the temperature is low. Precipitation is mostly in the form of snow, not rain.
	It usually dominates the Northern regions of the Earth and the polar regions. The tundra climate is seen at the following places: Northern parts of Siberia, northern regions of Canada, northern coast of Krolla Island, high mountains in the Central Belt, northern coasts of the European continent and the Scandinavian peninsula.
