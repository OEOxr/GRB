<div class="title"> Explorer Christopher Columbus who accidentally discovered America</div>
<br/>
<div>
  Born in Genoa in 1451, Italian explorer Columbus was an excellent mariner who gained experience by sailing the seas at early ages. In 1479, he married the daughter of a Portuguese nobleman and settled in Lisbon, but his greatest dream was to go to the Far East and China. Although it was argued that his ultimate goal was to be rich by bringing valuable goods from the Far East, or to spread Christianity worldwide as a sacred purpose of the time, and to colonize new lands by taking them in the name of God, Columbus actually had a theory. He believed that the world was round and by constantly travelling towards the west he would eventually return to his starting point and thus prove his theory. In those times, which was the 15th century, the earth was believed to be flat as a tray. It took him a long time to find funds for this journey and finally in 1492, with the support of King Ferdinand of Spain he was able to set sail.
  He headed west from the Canary Islands, crossed the Sargasso Sea and reached a piece of land. But what they saw was Waitling Island in the Bahamas, off the coast of America. Because Columbus’s calculations about reaching the Far East were completely wrong, given the conditions of the time, he believed he had reached northern China, in only two and a half months. He refused to accept his misconception until he died and never realized that he had actually arrived at the Americas. He named this newly discovered island “San Salvador” and continued his search for the richness of northern China. After visiting Cuba and the islands he called La Espanola he returned to Spain. Because he assumed that the islands he discovered were in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Asia, they were called the Indies.

Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci travelled to the lands discovered by Columbus and realized that this was not an Asia but a completely new continent, and this new world was named America in memory of Vespucci in 1507.
