<div class="title"> Machu Picchu</div>
<br/>
<div>
It is an ancient city of the Inca Civilization, located at the Urubamba Valley at an altitude of 2,360 meters in the Andes, 88 km from Cusco, Peru, one of the countries of the South American Continent. The city, built around 1450 by the Inca ruler Pachacutec Yupanqui, thanks to its geographical location, was not noticed or reached by the Spanish invaders who raided the continent in the 1500s. Therefore, it is very well preserved to this day. The city lies between two peaks called the Old Peak (Machu Picchu) and the Young Peak (Wayna Picchu), where the terraces around the buildings are thought to have been used as agricultural areas. Today, around 2,000 visitors come to Machu Picchu daily, making it the most popular tourist destination in South America. Therefore, a railway line has been built from Cusco City to the village of Aguas Calientes at the foot of Machu Picchu Mountain. For the remaining 8 km distance to the ancient city, visitors may either take a bus or just walk. For those willing to follow the footsteps of the Inca Civilization and take the antique road, hiking tours are available. Machu Picchu is listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site and has been voted to be one of the “Seven New Wonders of the World”.
