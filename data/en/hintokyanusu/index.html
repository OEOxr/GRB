	Monsoon climate dominates the Indian Ocean located in the tropical region. Monsoon winds blow from the sea to the land in summer and from the land to the sea winter works from. Currents in the Indian Ocean vary depending on theses winds. Southwestern monsoon currents in the north of the equator increasing in summer change direction in winter, turning into northeastern monsoon currents. The 66,526 km coastline and the Suez Canal (Egypt), Bab al-Mandeb (Djibouti-Yemen), the Strait of Hormuz (Iran-Oman) and the Strait of Malacca (Indonesia-Malaysia) are critical maritime passageways. Indian Ocean’s deepest point is the Sunda (Java) Trench (-7,258 m). The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean in the world after the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is located between 20° south latitude, 80° east longitude, Africa, The South Ocean and Australia. It covers an area of more than 5.5 times that of the USA with a total surface measurement of 68,556,000 km2. Its volume is estimated to be approximately 292,131,000 km3 with The Andaman Sea, Oman Sea, Bay of Bengal, Flores Sea, Great Australian Bight, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Java Sea, Mozambique Channel, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Savu Sea, Strait of Malacca and Timor Sea combined.
	In the ocean’s topography, there is a threshold called the Central Indian Ridge between the Indian Peninsula and the Rodriguez Islands east of Madagascar. This threshold divides the ocean into two parts. On this ridge are the islands of Laccadive, Chagos and Maldives while other important islands are Madagascar, Mauritius, Ceylon, Reunion, Rodriguez, Socatra, Andanans, Nicabars and Mergu.
