<div class="title">Moai Rock Statues (Easter Island)</div>
<br/>
<div>
  Easter is a Chilean island southeast of the Pacific Ocean, 3,700 km from the Chilean coast, consisting of three extinct volcanoes. Easter island, which is 2,000 km away from even the nearest residential area of Pitcairn Island, is therefore a very isolated place. Its surface area measures 162 km2. There are 638 volcanic rock statues called "Moai‚Äù on the island, which are numbered and classified by scientists. Their height ranges from 1 to 20 m and the largest one weighs 50 tons. The statues are made from volcanic rocks from the Ranu Rakau volcano with precision and excellent artistry. They are placed on top of rock platforms made with the same fine craftmanship and called "Ahu". All rock figures look at the same direction. Despite all the scientific research, the reasons and the date of their creation are still unknown. Thousands of visitors come to the island to see the statues that have kept their secrets to this day. Transportation is via Chile or Tahiti by air.
