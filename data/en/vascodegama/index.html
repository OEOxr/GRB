<div>
The Portuguese had managed to reach Cape of Good Hope and were trying to access India this way. King Manuel I commissioned an expedition to explore this new route and to find out other possible trade opportunities. So, Vasco da Gama set off in 1497 with four ships and 170 sailors. Although he had to struggle with epidemics and armed attacks during the journey, he spent 10 months at sea and finally managed to sail through the Indian Ocean in 23 days with the help of monsoon winds to anchor at the Indian port of Calcutta. Da Gama and his crew were welcomed by the Indians. They returned home after staying for three months in India. Thanks to this journey, a new trade route had been established.
