  In the 13th century, the Mongols had advanced into Europe as near as Hungary and Poland, which led to the idea that the Europeans could cooperate with the Mongols against their enemies: Turks. Although attempts to this end failed, some European countries nevertheless sent messengers to Karakorum, Mongolia's capital in Central Asia.
  <br/>
  In 1260, on their way back from a trade negotiation in Crimea, Maffeo and Niccolo Polo brothers were stalled due to a Mongol invasion and had to change their route. After a Mongolian representative they met by chance invited them to China, they had the opportunity to appear before China's Mongolian Emperor Kublai Khan and brought back with them an amicable letter addressed to the Pope, on their returning to Europe. The merchant brothers had succeeded in what the ambassadors had failed to achieve. In 1271, the Polo brothers set off for China a second time and they took with them Niccolo’s 15-year-old son Marco as well. This was the beginning of Marco Polo’s adventurous life as an explorer. Marco recorded everything he witnessed during the three-and-a-half months journey to Kublai Khan's palace in Khanbaliq (Beijing), in writing. The Polos held diplomatic posts for 17 years at Kublai Khan's palace, where they were welcomed amicably. Young Marco made trips to Sumatra, Tibet, Malaya, Sri Lanka, Burma and India on behalf of the Khan. Items that Marco Polo saw in China such as paper money, coal and gunpowder reached the West centuries later. The Polo family left China by means of a diplomatic mission, first arriving by sea at Hormuz port of the Persian Empire (Iran), they then travelled across Anatolia to reach Constantinople (Istanbul) and from there came back to Venice, 24 years after leaving their hometown.
  <br/>
  When Marco, who was imprisoned during the war between Venice and Genoa, told his cellmate, the writer Rustichello about his adventures, the book “The Travels of Marco Polo” became possible, and thanks to this book, Marco Polo became known to the world and he inspired the explorers who followed him.
