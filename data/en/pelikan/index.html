They have a peculiar chunky body and a unique beak. These waterfowls are known for the large amount of fish they consume, usually reaching four kilos a day. The beak sac can hold up to three gallons of water, which is more than three times the birdâ€™s stomach capacity. They have the largest beaks of any bird species. In some cases, the beak can reach up to 18 inches in length. They are extremely sociable birds that live in colonies of several hundred individuals. Mating occurs in the nest from three to ten days before egg laying. Both males and females are responsible for building nests using feathers, leaves and sticks.
