<div>
Arctic foxes live in the tundra and taiga regions of Asia, Europe, Greenland, Iceland and North America. The species was separated from domesticated dogs 12 million years ago. Individuals of the species can travel up to 155 km in a single day! These foxes are smart, curious and fast! When evading predators and hunting prey, they can run up to 50 kilometers per hour. Their fur is white to blend with ice in winter, and brown to camouflage among rocks in summer. They have furry paws that help to keep their body warm in winter. Thick ears, short snouts and multilayered coat also help Arctic foxes survive in freezing environments. They do not begin to shiver until the temperature drops to -70 Â°C. Arctic foxes don't live long. Although they are fast and agile, in the wild most turn into bear food between the ages of three and six.
