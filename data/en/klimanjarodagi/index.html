Kilimanjaro, consisting of 3 volcanic cones called Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira, is located in Tanzania within the boundaries of the national park named after it. At 5,895 meters, it is the highest mountain on the African continent. It is estimated to have formed about 1 million years ago during the formation of the Great Rift Valley. Uhuru Peak is located in the Kibo crater circle as the highest peak. Kilimanjaro, a giant stratovolcano, is thought to have had its most violent eruption 360,000 years ago. Its most recent significant activity took place 200 years ago. Despite being dormant, the Kibo crater still releases gas and smoke, and in 2003, scientists found that there was a distance of 400 meters between the Kibo crater and the liquid magma underneath.
