It is located at the southeast of Africa, in the Indian Ocean, with the Strait of Mozambique separating the island from Mozambique and the rest of Africa. Its surface area is 587,000 km² and it is the fourth largest island in the world with a population of around 12 million. Its official languages are Malagasy and French. It is basically a highland 1600 km long from north to south, with an average width of 500 km. The terrain is mostly composed of granite and quartzite, with volcanos forming high points. Mahacamba, Betsiboka, Tsiribihina, Mangoky are the main rivers draining into the Mozambique strait. Due to its geographical location, several climatic zones are observed on the Madagascar Island. The eastern slopes are open to Alize winds and receive abundant rainfall. The average temperature is high and increases by about 4°C in the northern parts which are nearer to the Equator. However, temperature decreases as elevations increase, and large tropical forests are replaced by forests called "Savoka". High lands in the central part receive less precipitation and the temperature is even lower, the annual average being 16 to 17°C, and the dry season is pronounced. Forest areas have been lost almost completely due to the proliferation of agricultural areas, and they have been replaced by thin meadows. The lowlands at the west which are open to winds, precipitation decreases and the dry season is long. As it becomes drier towards the southern and southwestern end, the main form of vegetation becomes dry bushes. The people are a mix of African, Arab, Malayo-Polynesian, Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani. The most densely populated parts are the central highlands as well as east, north and northwest coasts. Madagascar, being an agricultural country, relies mostly on rice, sugarcane, cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, pepper, cocoa and tobacco as main products.
