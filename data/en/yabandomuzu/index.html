Wild boar is an animal with an extremely wide geographical distribution with an estimated number of subspecies between 4 to 25. The wild boar, which is found in a wide variety of habitats, is an extremely adaptable animal since it can eat almost anything that fits into its mouth and can run fast and swim very well. Wild boars are nocturnal animals that appear only at night in search of food. They sleep for about 12 hours in a dense leaf bed throughout the day, before waking up at dusk to look for food. Female boars are sociable and live in groups known as sirens, which can hold between 6 and 30 individuals. Sirens consist of breeding females and their offspring, and although they tend not to mix, they can share the same area with other groups.
